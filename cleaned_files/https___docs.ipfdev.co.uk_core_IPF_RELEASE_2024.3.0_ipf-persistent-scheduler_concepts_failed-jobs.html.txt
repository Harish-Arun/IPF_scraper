Failed Jobs
A failed job is defined as a job that matches the following criteria:
It has missed its regular execution slot with its specification unchanged, OR;
It was scheduled to be in the past
Its specification was updated in a way to stop any further execution
The Failed Jobs Processor
When the system starts, it schedules an internal job to find other failed scheduled jobs.
This job behaves like any other scheduled job, but has a special task of identifying other jobs that have failed
according to the above criteria, and processes them (see below for details).
The frequency of execution is configurable, and it can be set using the following properties file:
package com.iconsolutions.ipf.core.platform.scheduler.persistent.job;

import lombok.Data;
import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties;

@Data
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "ipf.persistent.scheduler.process-failed-jobs")
public class ProcessFailedJobsProperties {
    private Boolean active;
    private String cronExpression;
}
active
: a flag to set if the job is active or not
cronExpression
: a cron expression to describe the frequency the job will run. For help with building a cron
expression, use an online cron expression builder such as
this one
.
The example below sets it to run once a day at 0:15:59:
ipf.persistent.scheduler.process-failed-jobs {
  active = true
  cron-expression = "59 15 0 */1 ? *"
}
Being notified of failed jobs
When configuring a
JobSpecification
, it is possible to be notified of failures for that specific job by specifying
the failure identifier and command:
JobSpecificationDto.builder()
    .jobRequestor(JOB_REQUESTOR)
    .triggerCommand(TEST_COMMAND)
    .schedulingSpecification(cronExpression)
    .failureIdentifier(failureIdentifier)
(1)
.failureCommand(failureCommand)
(2)
.build();
If this job has failed since the last checkpoint, then the relevant SchedulingHelper will be notified of this. Note that the
SchedulingHelper
will need to have the
supports
method updated to support the failure command too.
