Sizing Guidelines
Database Resources
ODS uses the following database collections to store payment information
Summaries
Summary objects represent a simple aggregate view representing a single payment / level of processing
Payments
All IPF Payment Model elements (ISO20022 messages elements etc.) used in the process flows are saved here in a standard ODS wrapper.
CustomObjects
If custom objects are being used in IPF processing flows, they will be persisted here with a standard ODS wrapper.
Processes
Process objects are a general term for a set of data points that are captured relating to the metadata on processing a payment through IPF, this includes:
Process Flow Definitions
Process Flow Invocation - start of IPF Process Flow
Process Flow Event - standardised versions of the IPF Domain Events used within the Journal
Message Logs - captures raw message exchange between IPF and external systems
System Events - low-level system events used to trigger metrics, such as circuit breaker open.
Due to the volume of system events, we would typically recommend that they are not loaded into ODS

. All the different underlying process object types use the same underlying database collection and so the same indexes
2
. Based on number of external systems and whether they are send-only or request/response
3
. Total size will be based on the underlying raw message size including headers etc. plus the ODS standard wrapper
