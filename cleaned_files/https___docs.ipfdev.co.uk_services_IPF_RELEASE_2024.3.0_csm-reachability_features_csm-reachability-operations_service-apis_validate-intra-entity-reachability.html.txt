Purpose
Validate if the payment can be settled "Inta Entity" (within the processing entity itself) without using an external CSM Agent.
Validates that the counterparty on the payment is on the Intra Entity Parties list and optionally the currency is on supported transfer currency list with Intra Entity flag as "True".
When response is "Reachable", the Processing Entity will be able to settle the payment "Intra Entity", without having to use an external CSM Agent.
Please refer API specs for the API for more details the schema, input and output attributes supported as well as sample responses.
