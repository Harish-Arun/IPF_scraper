Dynamic Configurations:
New dynamic configurations added (supported by DPS V1 APIs)
AgentSettings
AgentClearingSettings
CsAgentSelectionSettings
GenericProcessingSettings
IntraEntityParties
ProcessingEntityAccounts
SupportedTransferCurencies
New searchable fields for ProcessingEntity
Settings are moved from

Select CSM Agent implementation to work with new data model and with updated input and output definitions (/v2 version of the API)
Validate CSM Reachability implementation using new data structures
ConfigurableEnum annotation for client defined enum values
Changed
Dynamic Configurations:
CsmAgent data structure (replaced by AgentSettings)
CsmAgentCurrency data structure (replaced by new structures: AgentClearingSettings and AgentSettlementSetting)
OpeningTime and ClosingTime are now LocalDate type, not String, TimeZone field mandatory when opening or closing time provided
CsmAgentSelectionOrder changed into CsAgentSelectionSettings
ProcessingEntity data structure re-designed, some fields are removed, including BIC which is now combination of entityIdentifierType and entityIdentifierValue:
added :
field 'entityIdentifier' - list of Entityidentifiers
field 'entityAddress'
removed :
field 'clearingSystemIdentification'
field 'debtorAgentName'
field 'onUsCurrencyList' - list of OnUsCurrency
field 'suspenseAccountList' - list of SuspenseAccounts
changed:
field 'bic' is now combination of 'entityIdentifierType' and 'entityIdentifierValue'
field 'postalAddressStreetName' now is a part of Address property as 'streetName'
field 'postalAddressBuildingName' now is a part of Address property as 'buildingName'
field 'postalAddressPostalCode' now is a part of Address property as 'postCode'
field 'postalAddressTownName' now is a part of Address property as 'townName'
field 'postalAddressCountryCode' now is a part of Address property as configurable 'country'
Added LedgerCurrency attribute to Processing Entity configuration.
Database Impact
Settings that are no longer used and collections that need to be dropped are:
CsmAgent (
settings-csm-agent
)
CsmAgentSelectionOrder (
settings-csm-agent-selection-order
)
CsmAgentCurrency (
settings-csm-agent-currency
)
New settings should be used, and new collections created:
AgentSettings (
settings-agent-settings
)
AgentClearingSettings (
settings-agent-clearing-settings
)
AgentSettlementSettings (
settings-agent-settlement-settings
)
CsAgentSelectionSettings (
settings-cs-agent-selection-settings
)
GenericProcessingSettings (
settings-generic-processing-settings
)
CSM Reachability Runnable Application
Swagger UI page configured to be at path
/swagger-ui/index.html
Data Ingestion
New
Data ingestion implementation moved to new repository csm-reachability-data-ingestion
Six Bank Master load to Party Entity directory is now supported. Json files are parsed and loaded to party-entity collection.
One new module party-entity with 2 submodules: party-entity-swift and party-entity-six
New system event FileEntrySkippedEvent
Fixed file ingestion throttling.
Changed
Previous config for party entity file ingestion was
partyentity.process-bank-directory-plus.enabled = true
, now is changed to
swift.bankplus.process-bank-directory-plus.enabled = true
The old implementation has been kept for backward compatibility. Also, since now we have support for json file ingestion in party entity new configuration is added in new module for bank master
six.bankmaster process-bank-master.enabled = true
. For example:
party-entity.swift.bankplus {
  process-bank-directory-plus.enabled = true
  file-ingestion-connector.file-ingestion {
    files-directory = "/static/files"
    directory-id = "party-entity-swift"
    initial-delay = 9s
    interval = 1h
  }
}

six.bankmaster {
  process-bank-master.enabled = true
  file-ingestion-bankmaster-connector {
    file-ingestion {
      files-directory = "/static/files"
      directory-id = "party-entity-bank-master"
      initial-delay = 9s
      interval = 1h
    }
  }
}
