File Ingestion
Industry data is loaded to dynamic configurations using Dynamic Processing Settings. The files provided by industry sources use file ingestion implementation on IPF to load the data to the dynamic configurations.
IPF provides some file ingestion implementations out of the box (subject to licensing agreements) while custom file ingestions can be implemented by IPF client teams as per need.
IPF file ingestion supports two modes:
Sr No
Ingestion Mode
Description
1
Ingestion from local directory
This mode is used when the file ingestion is done by uploading the files to local file directory on client implementation network.
2
Ingestion from AWS S3 Buckets
This mode is used when client implementations want to use AWS S3 buckets to upload industry / custom files on to the dynamic configurations on IPF.
IMPORTANT
The local file directory mode is always available and S3 ingestion mode needs to be enabled through configurations.
In future, more modes of file upload can be made available as per client needs.
