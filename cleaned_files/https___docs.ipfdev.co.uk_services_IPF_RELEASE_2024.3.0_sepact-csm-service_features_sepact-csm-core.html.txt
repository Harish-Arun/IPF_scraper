Core Configuration
SEPA CT CSM Core configuration options and explanations.
Liquidity Adjustment Checkpoints Configuration
This config defines when the Scheme specified LAC window is closing and identifies the latest point in time up to which files will be accepted by the scheme.
The cut-off values for this configuration are aligned to the timings provided by the scheme and can be changed if the scheme times change.
It is recommended that these are not changed without having specific confirmation from the scheme as unintended change could cause the cycle times to be mis-aligned between the IPF implementation and the scheme, causing unwanted rejections / liquidity positions.
The standard values are populated for the STEP2 SCT CSM Service implementation, however, it is recommended that the client implementation teams compare the standard values against those specified by the scheme at the point of implementation and update the values if required.

Extra notes -  LAC Sending Cut-off Buffer Time
ipf.csm.sepa-ct.lac.sending-cutoffs
Buffer time ahead of LAC Sending cut-off (Refer Documentation) at which the file level bulk (e.g. ICF File) will be finalized to be sent to the scheme.
This begins creation of the files to be sent to the scheme ahead of the LAC Sending cut-offs and ensures that all the participants in the chain of events leading to the file being received by the scheme, have enough time to perform those steps.
Examples of the steps that should happen between LAC Sending Cut-Off Buffer and LAC Sending Cut-Off are:
Finalization of the bulks within IPF Bulker and generation of scheme files
Streaming of the files to the scheme through client file system
Validation of the files by the scheme in real time and generation of CVF responses
Generation of the LCR requests to the SCT service for settlement purposes
Settlement of the individual LCR requests by the scheme
This configuration is specific to IPF Bulker implementation designed to work with IPF STEP2 SCT CSM Service.
The client implementation teams should update the default value of the config to a value as per the volume and performance expectations from the IPF implementation.
Extra notes - EOD Real Time Validation Cut-Off
ipf.csm.sepa-ct.lac.eod-validation-cutoff
Scheme cut-off time when the Scheme stops Real Time Validation of the messages for same day settlement.
After this time, the scheme will reject any bulks that are sent to it with the same day value specified in the Interbank Settlement date.
Only files that should settle on the next business day(s) will be processed and warehoused.
Effectively, this is the latest that the bulks with same day settlement requests should be sent to SCT service.
The value of this configuration can be changed but this should be done as per scheme guidelines, unilateral change on the IPF implementation can cause unwanted rejections from the scheme.
Extra notes - Settlement Date Roll Over Buffer Time
ipf.csm.sepa-ct.lac.settlement-rollover-buffer
Buffer time ahead of Real Time Validation Cut-off time (Refer documentation), at which the Current Settlement Date value on STEP2 SCT CSM Service is rolled over to the next valid Target2 Business day.
Beyond this time, the messages with the same day settlement date value will be rejected by STEP2 SCT CSM Service.
This configuration is also used for validations of the Interbank Settlement date on submitted bulks through Clear and Settle route as well as the Validation API.
The client implementation teams should update the default value of the config to a value as per the volume and performance expectations from the IPF implementation.
Extra notes - CGS EOD Output Delivery Extension Configuration
The property
ipf.csm.sepa-ct.lac.opening-extension.extension-in-minutes
is intended to extend the CGS EOD cut-off time.
If this value is set, the CGS EOD cut-off time will be extended by the specified number of minutes.
If the value is not set, the default value of 0 minutes will be used.
Allowed values for this property range from 0 to 360 minutes. For example, if
cgsEodCutoffDateTime
is 5 PM CEST and
extensionInMinutes
is configured to 10 minutes, the new
cgsEodCutoffDateTime
will be scheduled for 5:10 PM CEST.

Extra notes - CGS EOD Output Delivery Phase Buffer
ipf.csm.sepa-ct.lac.cgs-eod-output-delivery-buffer
A buffer time after the CGS EOD cut-off, after which the output files should reach the CSM Service after CGS EOD has started.
If the RSF files are not received after this buffer time has passed beyond the CGS EOD cut-off, the CSM Service will assume there have not been any settlement failures / cancellations and will send a "Settlement Success response" to the client flows in form of pacs.002 message.
This configuration defines the longest the STEP2 SCT CSM Service will wait to be informed of settlement failures through RSF files before assuming settlement success.
The configuration should allow enough time for all the steps required for the files to reach IPF STEP2 SCT CSM Service from the scheme to avoid sending successful settlement responses to the client implementation flows while settlement failures get informed through RSF failures.
If this configuration is not set carefully, this could cause serious challenges with the settlement confirmations and will involve higher operational work to revert accounting entries.
Processing Entity Configuration

ipf.csm.sepa-ct.processing-entity.valid-agent-bics
Map
Must be provided in order for SEPA CT CSM Service to start. Each map entry contains a valid direct participant bic value and a list of valid indirect participant bic values associated with this direct participant bic:
[
{
direct-participant-bic = "ICONGBA0"
indirect-participant-bics = [
"ICONGBA1"

Not provided
ipf.csm.sepa-ct.processing-entity.pacs008-duplicate-message-check-period
Period
Sets the duplicate validation period for Pacs.008 messages. The check considers a previous message with the same
message header a duplicate only when it has been created in the given period and ignores it otherwise. If set to
0
the check falls down to the default behaviour.

Camt0x7 Payment Adapter Sender
See the
SEPA CSM Inquiry API
for description of the types
For inbound Camt.0x7 messages, we have created a new connector that supports sending Camt.027 or Camt.087 messages to the Payment Adapter and Client Service Implementation. Two types of request objects are supported:
ReceiveInquiryClaimRequest - CAMT.027
ReceiveInquiryModifyRequest - CAMT.087
The following configuration property allows you to define the name of the Kafka topic to which the notifications are published. We can configure whether we want to turn on or off this type of notification using the property.
