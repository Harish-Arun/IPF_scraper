Filter Messages
How do I filter messages so they are not passed to my receive handler?
This Connector example shows how you can filter messages based on their header values.
Defining a Filter
Simply define a filter by defining Criteria as such:
var propNameToFilterOn = "myprop";

        new ReceiveConnector
                .Builder<String>("OurReceiver")
                .withActorSystem(actorSystem)
                .withConnectorTransport(receivingTransport)
                .withMessageLogger(logger())
                .withFilterCriteria(new MessageHeaderCriteria(propNameToFilterOn, "1"))
(1)
.withReceiveTransportMessageConverter(a -> a.getPayload().toString())
                .withManualStart(false)
                .withProcessingContextExtractor(a -> ProcessingContext.unknown())
                .withSkipCorrelationOn(a -> true)
                .withReceiveHandler((receivingContext, response) ->
                        CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> list.add(response))
                                .thenApply(a -> null))
                .build();

Defining the filter
In the above example, we filter out (i.e. do not accept) any messages that have a property name
myprop
having the
value
1
.
Note that it is possible to write custom
Criteria
and also use logical AND and OR operators to combine operators.
See
