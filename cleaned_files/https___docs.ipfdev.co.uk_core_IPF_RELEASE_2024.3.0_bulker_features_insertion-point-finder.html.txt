Insertion Point Finder
A
InsertionPointFinder
is a pluggable component whose purpose is to detect byte position where child components will be injected into that component. Those positions are called Insertion Points.
A component hierarchy is used to define how each component relates to each other, and where within one components content its child components content should be placed.
Concrete implementation are expected to know the format of the content of a component, i.e. xml, json , csv, etc.. This is required, since the joining of the components is dependent on the way the data is structured. That is why a separate
InsertionPointFinder
implementation is going to be needed for each format.
Interface
The
InsertionPointFinder
interface is defined as follows.
public interface InsertionPointFinder {
    String getName();
(1)
List<InsertionPoint> find(String content, Node node);
(2)
}
1
getName
returns a name of the InsertionPointFinder.
2
find
takes a bulk component
Content
, a bulk specification
Node
and returns a
InsertionPoint
list.
Implementations
Currently only supports XML.
