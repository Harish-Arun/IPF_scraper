Create a new IPF Application Project
To create a brand new IPF Application project we advise using the
Archetype starter
as this is the quickest way to bootstrap a new project using the IPF SDK. The Maven archetype will generate a Maven project (using the Icon BOM as its parent) containing;
an application skeleton (home for the application runtime code)
a flow domain (artefacts related to the DSL and flow definitions)
a test module (containing the docker application configuration)
From this base you can then wire in any additional capability you need, either from the
Flo Starter Projects
or other IPF component libraries.
