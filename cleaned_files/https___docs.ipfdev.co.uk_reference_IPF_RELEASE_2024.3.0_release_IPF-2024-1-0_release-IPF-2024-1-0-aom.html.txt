Bank Filtering
Fixed responses for getAll BankFilteringRules, CsmAgents, ProcessingEntity in Swagger UI.

The location of country code in BIC is fixed.
Removed filtering by NCC, this will be re-introduced in the PI 2024.2
Rule direction changed from DEBTOR, CREDITOR, BOTH to DEBTOR, CREDITOR, ANY. Handling direction ANY implemented to work as logical OR, which means its applied to input debtor agent or creditor agent.
