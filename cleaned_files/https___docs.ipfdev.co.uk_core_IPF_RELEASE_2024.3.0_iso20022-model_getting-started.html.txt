Getting Started
The Java representation of the ISO20022 message model for IPF is wholly found with the below maven artefact, this
includes types, serialisers and validators etc. The version of the artefact is defined as part of the IPF Core Release
BOM.
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.iconsolutions.iso20022.model</groupId>
    <artifactId>message-model</artifactId>
    <version>${icon-iso20022-model.version}</version>
</dependency>
Within this repository the key class is
ISO20022MessageModel
, which serves as a central access point for
validation and serialisation, and registration point for associated rule implementations and supporting contexts.
If you are in the process of migrating an old (pre Q2 2023 IPF Project) that uses the legacy model representation (and
specifically need both models to co-exist) then utilities for conversion between models can be found in the below
optional artifact.
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.iconsolutions.iso20022.model</groupId>
    <artifactId>migration-pack</artifactId>
    <version>${icon-iso20022-model.version}</version>
</dependency>
For a full breakdown of the differences between these models and how to migrate from one version to the latter please
