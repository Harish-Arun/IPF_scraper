Given
the IPF service is healthy
none
Confirms that the IPF system is ready to start processing and all health checks have successfully passed
Given the IPF service is healthy
Then
the last $number of received '$messageType' were equivalent
number
- ?
messageType
- ?
description tbc
Then the last 3 of received 'Sanctions Requests' were equivalent
Then
_\{the |\}$sendingSystem sends \{a|an\} duplicate '$messageType'

Then the SanctionsSystem sends a duplicate SanctionsResponse
Aggregate Steps
Type
Step Definition
Parameters
Description
Example
Then
the '$flowDefinitionId' flow is in state '$desiredState'
flowDefinitionId
- the unique id of a flow, this is the concatenation of flow name and version, e.g. CreditTransferFlowV1
desiredState
- the target state name, e.g. Completed
Provides the ability to check a flow is in a given state, this usage assumes that the test has a single unique instance of the provided flowDefinitionId.
Then the 'ParamsHttpFlow' flow is in state 'Complete'
Then
the '$flowDefinitionId' flow for requestId '$requestId' is in state '$desiredState'
flowDefinitionId
- the unique id of a flow, this is the concatenation of flow name and version, e.g. CreditTransferFlowV1
requestId
- the client request id that initiated the required flow.
desiredState
- the target state name, e.g. Completed
Provides the ability to check a flow is in a given state, this usage allows provision of a distinguishing request id for provided flowDefinitionId.
Then the 'ParamsHttpFlow' flow for requestId 'my-client-request-id' is in state 'Complete'
Then
there is no '$flowDefinitionId' flow created
flowDefinitionId
- the unique id of a flow, this is the concatenation of flow name and version, e.g. CreditTransferFlowV1
Checks to see that there no flow of the required definition id has been created.
Then there is no 'ParamsHttpFlow' flow created
Then
the flow with ID '$aggregateId' is in state '$desiredState'
aggregateId
- the unique identifying aggregate id of a flow
desiredState
- the target state name, e.g. Completed
Checks that the defined flow is in the given state.
Then flow with ID 'ParamsHttpFlow|abc' is in state 'Complete'
Then
the list of published domain events for the '$flowDefinitionId' flow is: $values
flowDefinitionId
- the unique id of a flow, this is the concatenation of flow name and version, e.g. CreditTransferFlowV1
values - a list of event names
Provides the ability to check that the events provided have been successfully generated for the provided flow definition id.  This step assumes there will be a single flow of this type within the test.  The step will pass if and only if the provided list is an exact match for the events on the aggregate.
Then the list of published domain events for the 'ParamsHttpFlow' flow is:
| event1 |
| event2 |
System Event Steps
Type
Step Definition
Parameters
Description
Example
Then
a new $flowDefinitionId flow is started
flowDefinitionId
- the unique id of a flow, this is the concatenation of flow name and version, e.g. CreditTransferFlowV1
This step checks that a flow started system event for the given flow exists. It assumes a single flow in the test for the provided definition.
Then a new 'ParamsHttpFlow' flow is started
Then
a '$eventName' event is raised
eventName - the name of the event being looked for
This step looks for the appearance of a system event for the defined name.  It does not consider which flow this event emanated from
Then a 'SanctionsPassed' event is raised
