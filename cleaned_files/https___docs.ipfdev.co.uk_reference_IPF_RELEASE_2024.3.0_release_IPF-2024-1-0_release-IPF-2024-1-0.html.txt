Migration Steps
Java 17
As was announced in the previous two releases, release 2024.1.0 makes Java 17 mandatory for developing, building, and running IPF. Please ensure that you are using a Java 17 JDK in:
Your development environment
Your CI environment
Your container base image
MPS 2022.3
We have now upgraded to using MPS 2022.3 for the design environment which allows us to introduce new features to our Flo Lang DSL. Please ensure you have installed MPS 2022.3 prior to using IPF 2024.1:
Windows:
download.jetbrains.com/mps/2022.3/MPS-2022.3.1.exe
Linux:
download.jetbrains.com/mps/2022.3/MPS-2022.3.1.tar.gz
You will also need the corresponding
2022.3.24237.f0c4f91
version of
com.mbeddr:platform
, which is located in the
Itemis MPS Repository
.
MPS project generation in windows is not correctly moving files
If projects are built on CI, and the CI system is unix-based theres nothing to change
This has been fixed for the next release. As a workaround in the meantime, add the contents of
[myapp]-domain/domain/target/ipf-conf-merge-files/merged-ipf-conf-files/conf/[name of model]/ipf.conf
to any other config file that isnt part of the autogenerated code e.g. in
ipf-impl.conf
of the
-app
module
