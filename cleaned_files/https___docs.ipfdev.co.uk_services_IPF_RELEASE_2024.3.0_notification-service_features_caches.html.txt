Caches
Payment Data Cache
This services instantiates an
Async Cache Adapter
.
It caches all payment related objects such as PAIN_001.
It requires the following configuration to be provided:
data-cache.retry-delay = 2s
Custom Data Cache
This services instantiates an
Async Cache Adapter
.
It caches all custom related objects by configurable
custom-data-keys
field, which takes a list of names to extract from a CustomObjectContainer.
payment-status-notification.resequencer.custom-data-keys = []
It also requires the retry delay to be provided if retrieval by ods is supported:
data-cache.retry-delay = 2s
Pds Data Cache
This services instantiates an
Async Cache Adapter
.
It caches all pds related objects by configurable
pds-data-keys
field, which takes a list of names to extract from a PdsObjectContainer.
payment-status-notification.resequencer.pds-data-keys = []
It also requires the retry delay to be provided if retrieval by ods is supported:
data-cache.retry-delay = 2s
Notification Settings Cache
This cache instantiates an
Async Cache Adapter
.
It caches all notification settings. It is then used by the Connector implementation and by the MongoDB implementation, which use the adapter to put and retrieve the data from the cache.
This will avoid unnecessary calls to external services when the data is available in the cache.
Async Cache Adapter
Two types of Async Cache Adapters can be instantiated. Worth reviewing the
IPF-Cache
documentation to understand the different options in more detail. The current configuration which can be overridden is covered here.
ipf.caching.caffeine.enabled = false

ipf.caching.infinispan {
  enabled = true
  cache-manager-name = "infinispanCacheManager"
    settings {
      payment-data {
        max-count = 19000000
        timeout = 4h
        cache-mode = REPL_ASYNC
      }
      custom-data {
        max-count = 19000000
        timeout = 4h
        cache-mode = REPL_ASYNC
      }
      pds-data {
        max-count = 19000000
        timeout = 4h
        cache-mode = REPL_ASYNC
      }
      resequencer-state {
        max-count = 19000000
        timeout = 5m
        cache-mode = REPL_ASYNC
      }
      notification-settings {
        max-count = 100
        timeout = 1h
        cache-mode = REPL_ASYNC
      }
   }
}
Caffeine Cache
In order to enable Caffeine Cache this property needs to be set:
ipf.caching.caffeine.enabled = true
For additional configuration that needs to be provided for Caffeine cache, please read the documentation on
Caffeine Configuration
.
Three Async Cache Adapters are instantiated using the Caffeine Cache Factory if the configuration is set to use Caffeine:
Payment Data
Custom Data
Pds Data
Notification Settings
In Notification Service we use infinispan as our caching option.
In case we want to switch to caffeine, we just need to change the enabled property from
false
to
true
and set the following properties for
payment-data
and
notifications-settings
:
ipf.caching.caffeine {
    enabled = false
    settings {
       payment-data {
          max-size = 100000
          timeout = 80s
       }
       notification-settings {
          max-size = 1
          timeout = 1ms
       }
    }
}
Infinispan Cache
In order to enable Infinispan Cache this property needs to be set:
ipf.caching.infinispan.enabled = true
For additional configuration that needs to be provided for Infinispan cache, please read the documentation on
Infinispan Configuration
.
Two Async Cache Adapters are instantiated using the Infinispan Cache Factory if the configuration is set to use Infinispan:
Payment Data
Custom Data
Notification Settings
And here is an example on how we can set the properties for
payment-data
and
notifications-settings
:
ipf.caching.infinispan {
    enabled = true
    cache-manager-name = "infinispanCacheManager"
    settings {
       payment-data {
          max-count = 100000
          timeout = 80s
          cache-mode = REPL_ASYNC
       }
       # We don't want to cache the notification settings because each test has different notification settings
       notification-settings {
          max-count = 1
          timeout = 1ms
          cache-mode = REPL_ASYNC
       }
    }
}
