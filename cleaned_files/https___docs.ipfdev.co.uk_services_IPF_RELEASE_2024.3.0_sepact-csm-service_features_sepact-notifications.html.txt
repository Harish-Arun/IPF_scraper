Clients can optionally enable notifications for when files produced by SEPA CT are ready for consumption. When enabled, subscribe to the applicable Kafka topic (configurable as per below) to receive the following notifications generated by the SEPA CT STEP2 CSM service:
BulkFileReadyNotification
InboundValidationFailureNotification
Configuration
The following configuration property allows you to define the name of the Kafka topic the notifications are published to.

As indicated in the table below, if a file is successfully produced but archiving fails, an error is logged in the application logs but a
BulkFileReadyNotification
is still sent as a failure to archive should not prevent processing by SEPA
