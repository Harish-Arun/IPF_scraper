Cluster Health
Introduction
The cluster health screen is a technical screen providing the information gathered from the health actuator endpoint.
It provides information on the nodes IP and health. It is useful to identify any members of a cluster or other IPF services.
The status of the services will only appear here if they have been configured in the dashboard configuration.
