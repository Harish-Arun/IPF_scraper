Industry Data
Industry Data
Industry data is the reference data that is provided by Industry sources and is common across all processing entities.
Industry data is provided by the industry providers and IPF clients should subscribe to the data to be able to load these into relevant data structures.
Industry data is loaded into IPF data structures using file ingestion applications which in turn use DPS Setting Management APIs to maintain dynamic configuration records created through industry data sources.
Industry data is supported on below dynamic configurations:
CSM Participants
Party Entity Directory
IBAN Plus Directory (IBAN Plus, IBAN Structure, IBAN Exclusion List)
Bic Dir 2018
The industry data can also be defined as client specific implementation where a custom membership definitions are required. These usually need a client specific implementations to be done when client teams have identified a need to upload a bespoke reference data into IPF data structures. The mapping from client specific sources need to be defined and implemented into IPF standard data structures for the look-ups to work.
