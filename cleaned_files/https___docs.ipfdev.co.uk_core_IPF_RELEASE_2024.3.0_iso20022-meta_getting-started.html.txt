Getting Started
Open the iso20022-mps MPS project, currently built with MPS 2021.3.1
Once the project is loaded you should see various solutions, which are described in detail in later sections, for now if you select the
com.iconsolutions.iso20022.repository.ipf
solution, you will find a preloaded repository with the components present, as below.
Some editors are represented as tables, many are not implemented yet and resolved to the standard reflection editor, these will be implemented incrementally
If you generate the solution a Java representation of the message model and domain model will be generated to the solutions
source_gen
folder.
There is some additional maven plugin configuration for the subsequent "reference" modules which (in a fashion similar to flo-lang) extract out the business and message models into different Maven modules
