How to Run Stand-Alone IPF Applications
IPF applications are all created with 2 maven profiles:
container
- Generates docker containers
runnable
- Generates a runnable jar to run as a standalone application
This document focuses on how to run IPF applications as standalone applications using the runnable jars generated from the
runnable
profile.
Where to Download Runnable Jars
All the applications that IPF produce get pushed to
ipf-releases
in Nexus. The runnable jars will be available as an artifact with a suffix of
runnable
in the Nexus repository for each version of the application you need. For example if you want to fetch the ODS ingestion runnable jar for version 2.1.2 you would find it at this link:
nexus.ipf.iconsolutions.com/repository/ipf-releases/com/iconsolutions/ipf/ods/ods-ingestion-app/2.1.2/ods-ingestion-app-2.1.2-runnable.jar
How to Generate Runnable Jars
When building an IPF application using the scaffolder projects both the
container
and
runnable
will be generated in the pom.xml.
If you want to generate the runnable you will need to invoke the
runnable
profile as follows:
mvn clean install -P runnable
How to Run Runnable Jars
All IPF runnable jars are produced as Spring Boot applications. To run an IPF application, taking the ODS ingestion jar above as an example, you would execute the following:
java -cp ods-ingestion-app-2.1.2-runnable.jar:config -Dconfig.override_with_env_vars=true -Dloader.main=com.iconsolutions.ipf.ods.OdsIngestionApplication org.springframework.boot.loader.launch.PropertiesLauncher
If using windows we need to replace the first
:
with a
;
- for example,
ods-ingestion-app-2.1.2-runnable.jar;config
If you are overriding any of the default configuration for the applications then, in this example, the configuration file for the application, application.conf, would live in the config folder as defined by
:config
. We then leverage the Spring Boot
PropertiesLauncher
to load the properties into the application.
Adding Connector Metrics to Runnable Jars
Currently, our docker images are already instrumented with the cinnamon agent jar for connector metrics reporting. This was not possible when producing the runnable jar as we are not in control of the deployment, which is up to the client. More information on connector metrics is available
here
.
To enable cinnamon metrics on runnable jars you would need to download the correct version of the cinnamon jar. The correct version to download will be in the BOM under the property
cinnamon.version
. The jar will also be inside the runnable jar itself and can be extracted from the jar. Add the javaagent when running the java program as follows:
java -javaagent:/lib/cinnamon-agent-2.19.3.jar -cp ods-ingestion-app-2.1.2-runnable.jar:config -Dconfig.override_with_env_vars=true -Dloader.main=com.iconsolutions.ipf.ods.OdsIngestionApplication org.springframework.boot.loader.launch.PropertiesLauncher
