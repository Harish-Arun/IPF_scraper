Scheduling Module
The scheduling module is how to interact with the IPF Persistent scheduler. It offers typical scheduling operations that
you would expect to see on such a tool. They are documented below.
scheduleJob
and
updateJob
- [re]schedule a job
This method takes a
JobSpecificationDto
, persists the job specification and enqueues the job to run in Quartz with the
relevant scheduler cron expression ("specification") and calendar if present.
Note that if the key for this job already exists, then the existing job will be updated to this new specification.
cancelJob
- cancel a job
Takes the
JobSpecificationKey
only, and any future executions of this job - if any - will not be executed. Please note
that the execution history of the job will be retained.
findJobById
- get a jobs latest status
Takes the
JobSpecificationKey
of a job and returns its specification and latest run status.
