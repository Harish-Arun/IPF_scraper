The Action Helper
This can be thought of as the engine that receives the scheduled commands to run. It awaits messages from the scheduler
which - when the time comes to run a job as per the cron expression - will hand the command to the
SchedulingHelper
and
being executing
Interface
The
SchedulingHelper
has two methods:
execute(String, Command)
: Run a task
This is what the scheduler will call at the right time. The "String" is the
triggerIdentifier
from the
JobSpecification
, and the
Command
is the
triggerCommand
from the same specification.
supports(Command)
: Does this SchedulingHelper support this command?
When defining multiple SchedulingHelpers, the scheduler needs to know which
SchedulingHelper
can support which command.
