Core Modules

Optional modules

Ops GUI Starter
The starter module can be used as a dependency of a custom client implementation. It will provide
everything that the service needs to run, but not more than that, it will be just an empty shell with
authentication capabilities.
API docs
The starter will include Open API documentation via SpringDoc. The Swagger UI will be accessible at
localhost:8082/swagger-ui.html
, assuming that you started the application using the functional end to end
docker cluster.
