The Updater: Handling Dangling Nodes
When an IPF node using Akka Discovery MongoDB gracefully shuts down, the plugin removes its own entry from the MongoDB
collection as a Coordinated Shutdown step.
In some containerised cases where the IPF application takes a long time to stop, it may be killed (
SIGKILL
) by the
container orchestration engine (e.g. Docker, Docker Compose, Kubernetes).
In this case, Coordinated Shutdown will not have a chance to run, and so there will be some dangling references to
nonexistent nodes in the database collection. New nodes starting up will try to contact these ghost nodes, which will
slow down the startup process.
To handle this situation, the plugin creates a MongoDB
TTL index
which deletes old entries based on their
lastUpdated
value.
By default, each node updates its own
lastUpdated
entry every 30 seconds. This index will purge entries that have not
been updated for 60 seconds. These values are all configurable, and the updater can be disabled.
