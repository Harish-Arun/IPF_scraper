When the Payment Service sends a 'Status Request'
Then the CSM receives a 'Payment Status Request' with values:
| FIToFIPmtStsReq.OrgnlGrpInf.OrgnlMsgNmId | pacs.008.001.02 |
When CSM sends a 'Send Outcome' with values:
| HEADER.IPG_SEND_OUTCOME        | <Result>        |
| HEADER.IPG_SEND_FAILURE_REASON | <FailureReason> |
Then Payment Service receives a  'Technical Response' with values:
| status | <Result>        |
| reason | <FailureReason> |
When the CSM sends a 'Payment Status Report' with values:
| fIToFIPmtStsRpt.orgnlGrpInfAndSts.orgnlMsgId   | #StatusRequest.payload.content.grpHdr.msgId |
| fIToFIPmtStsRpt.orgnlGrpInfAndSts.orgnlMsgNmId | pacs.028.001.001                            |
Then the Payment Service receives a 'Status Request Response'
