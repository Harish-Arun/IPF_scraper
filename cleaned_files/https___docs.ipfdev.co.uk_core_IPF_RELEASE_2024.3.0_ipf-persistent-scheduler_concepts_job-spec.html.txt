Job Specification and Status
This page explains the job specification and status:
Job Specification
The job specification is the way to tell the IPF Persistent Scheduler how to run a scheduled job. It consists of the
following parts:
Name
Mandatory?
Description
jobSpecificationKey
Yes
a unique identifier for this job
jobRequestor
Yes
A unique identifier for the requestor (a requestor can have multiple jobs)
schedulingSpecification
Yes
The cron expression for this job
triggerCommand
Yes
The
Command
to send to the SchedulingHelper at the scheduled time(s)
triggerIdentifier
Yes
An ID to use to send to the SchedulingHelper at the scheduled time(s)
failureCommand
Yes
When a failed execution is detected, the SchedulingHelper will receive this message.
failureIdentifier
Yes
An ID to use to send to the SchedulingHelper at the scheduled time(s)
calendar
No
Calendar to use for this job (see
Calendars
)
zoneId
No
A time-zone id, such as
Europe/Paris
, used to override default system time zone when scheduling a task. List of
zone ids
.
deleteTime
No
Used for TTL index.
One time jobs that have been executed successfully. One time jobs that have failed execution. All jobs that have been cancelled.
All these jobs, will be updated with a "delete time" and will no longer be available when querying them in the database.
It will allow us to quickly retrieve the latest job specifications, and filter out (in case of rehydration) the jobs that have been excluded.
Job Execution Status
The
JobExecutionStatus
collection is linked to the
JobSpecification
collection by the
jobSpecificationId
field.
The
JobExecutionStatus
collection is going to change more frequently, because the status of a job changes more frequently than its specification.
It contains the
jobSpecificationId
, the
executionStatus
the
updatedTime
and the
deleteTime
.
It is an append only collection and in order to get the current job execution status we just need to order by
updatedTime
and get the latest more recent entry.
Similarly to the
JobSpecification
collection, the
deleteTime
field is used for TTL index.
In addition, for recurrent jobs, when a job is triggered, the previous entry will be marked for deletion. Only the most recent entry is worth keeping.
Status definitions
The different statuses are:
SCHEDULED
: Is scheduled to run (and may have run in the past)
TRIGGERED
: Has already run and will not run again
CANCELED
: Was previously
SCHEDULED
but was not triggred
FAILED
: Failed to execute
Failed Jobs
