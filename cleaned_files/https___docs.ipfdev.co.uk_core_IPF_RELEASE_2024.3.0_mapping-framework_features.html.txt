Features
The framework is designed to transform Java objects into other Java objects, taking the heavy-lifting away from developers
so they can focus on more important tasks, including the conversion of messages between wire format and Java which is a prerequisite
to the use of the framework.
The framework offers the following features:
Generate mapping configuration templates to fill in for each defined pair of Java classes we want to map
Generate a Java POJO-to-POJO mapping and enrichment service from
HOCON configuration files
The framework is powered by
Freemarker
as a templating engine and by
Orika
as a mapping engine.
See the
getting started
section to start defining your mappings and generating the transformation code.
