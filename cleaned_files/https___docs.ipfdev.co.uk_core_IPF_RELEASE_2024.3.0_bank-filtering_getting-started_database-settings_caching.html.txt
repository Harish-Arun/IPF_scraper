Cache
On the application start, all bank exclusion/blocking lists from the dynamic configuration are loaded to the cache.
It makes bank exclusion calls faster and reduces number of requests to the dynamic configuration.
Only
ACTIVE
dynamic configurations are being pulled into cache.
Cache is synchronized with dynamic configuration periodically, by getting all data and putting refreshed values to the cache.
Cache parameters
Cache configuration is done under property
ipf.bank-filtering.cache.concurrenthashmap
Following parameters are used:
Config
Type
Comment
Default
reload
Duration
The period between successive executions
PT1H
Cache Health
On application start, the application will perform an initial load from the dynamic settings database, and then application will enter an UP (ready) state.
Bank filtering extends Spring Boot actuator health with additional data of cache status and implementation details.
In the example below, actuator health shows that bankFilteringCache is UP (meaning initial data load is done) and implementation is done by using Concurrent Hash Map.
"bankFilteringCache": {
  "status": "UP",
  "details": {
    "implementation": "Concurrent Hash Map cache"
  }
}
