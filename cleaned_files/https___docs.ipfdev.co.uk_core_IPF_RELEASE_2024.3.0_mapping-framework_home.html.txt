IPF Mapping Framework
An important part of the responsibilities of IPF is the adaptation of bank systems to third-party systems and vice versa.
This is traditionally achieved by writing code that receives and validates the input, maps it to a message that suits the target system,
enriches it with contextual information and sends it across.
The message mapping and enrichment has traditionally been code intensive, however, IPF Mapping Framework turns it into
a configuration-driven, low-code task.
