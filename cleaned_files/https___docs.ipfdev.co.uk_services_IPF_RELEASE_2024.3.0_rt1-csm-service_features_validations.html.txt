Validations
The purpose of this page is to summarise the additional usage validations performed by the RT1 scheme pack when processing a message.
All messages undergo an XSD schema check to make sure that the fields are technically correct, but only certain fields have additional usage validations performed on them.  If an additional usage validation is not listed below then it is not validated by the scheme pack.
Outbound (to scheme) messages have more validations performed than the Inbound (from scheme). This is in line with Icons rationale and prioritisation of making sure client constructed messages conform to all scheme rules and are not likely to be rejected. Messages from the scheme have, however, already been validated, so the priority for those is swift, safe processing through to the customers account.
Inbound pacs.008
The following validations are performed on an Inbound pacs.008, failures will result in a pacs.002 sent back to the scheme with the Return Code quoted below, and a system event to inform the Client.
