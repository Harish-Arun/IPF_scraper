Validations
The purpose of this page is to summarise the additional usage validations performed by the TIPS scheme pack when processing a message.
All messages undergo an XSD schema check to make sure that the fields are technically correct, but only certain fields have additional usage validations performed on them.  If an additional usage validation is not listed below then it is not validated by the scheme pack.
Outbound (to scheme) messages have more validations performed than the Inbound (from scheme). This is in line with Icons rationale and prioritisation of making sure client constructed messages conform to all scheme rules and are not likely to be rejected. Messages from the scheme have, however, already been validated, so the priority for those is swift, safe processing through to the customers account.
Inbound pacs.008
The following validations are performed on an Inbound pacs.008, failures will result in a pacs.002 sent back to the scheme with the Return Code quoted below, and a system event to inform the Client.

Inbound pacs.004
The TIPS Scheme rules do not allow a pacs.004 to be rejected by the receiving bank. The scheme pack therefore does not perform any additional field validations. A technical validation of the message will be performed against the xsd in order to certain that it is not malformed or has been truncated, after this however, the message is passed to the client implementation flow for processing. It is the responsibility of the bank to decide if the return can be posted to the customer account or if it needs to be handled via exception processing.

System event raised to payment service stating an invalid pacs.002 was received
When processing an incoming (from scheme) pacs.002 message which is in response to an outgoing (to scheme) pacs.008 message the only additional validation check performed is to check that the pacs.002
received correlates with an outbound pacs.008. If the pacs.008 cannot be located then a system event is raised to payment service stating an invalid pacs.002 was received.
