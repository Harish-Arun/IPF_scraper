IPF Persistent Scheduler
Introduction
IPFs Persistent Scheduler allows you to schedule jobs of any kind.
It is based on the
Quartz scheduler
, and works with cron expressions in combination
with calendars in order to execute one-time or recurrent jobs.
It also features a persistence layer whose main role is to keep single source of truth with regards to the definition
of tasks and also persists job history in an append-only journal.
The Scheduler also features failsafes such as a rescheduling module which runs at startup and restores all the scheduled
jobs back into Quartz after a previous failure. To use the Scheduler, start with
SchedulingModuleInterface
.
Finally, it is designed to be run in a
Akka Cluster
to ensure that jobs are scheduled across the cluster and can survive any number of node failures (including a total outage). Certain aspect like rehydration of jobs and processing of failed jobs are run on a
Cluster Singleton
to prevent duplicate processing in these scenarios.
The architecture for the scheduler is shown below:
