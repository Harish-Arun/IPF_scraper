SIX Bank Master 3.0 Mapping
SIX Bank Master 3.0 provides two types of records:
Bank Master - This record provides details of the participant with an active participant which has not been taken over by another participant.
Bank Master Concatenated - This record provides details of the participant that has been taken over by another participant but is still being used actively using the identifiers issued to it before the merger.
Depending on how the configurations are set, the records are added for one, more than one or all three of CSM Agents supported by SIX (Scheme operating SIC specific Swiss Domestic payments.). The membership for each of the CSM Agents is based on the flags provided by SIX on Bank Master 3.0.
