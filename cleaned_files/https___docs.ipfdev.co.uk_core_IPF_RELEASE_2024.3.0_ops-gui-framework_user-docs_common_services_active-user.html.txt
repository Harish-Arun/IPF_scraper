Active User
The active user service gets the username of the active user by decoding the JWT token. It uses the
ngx-cookie-service
to get the JWT from the browser cookie.
It also gets the allowed processing entities from the JWT token.
Example usage:
private getUserName(): void {
        this.userName = this.activeUserService.getActiveUserInfo();
    }
