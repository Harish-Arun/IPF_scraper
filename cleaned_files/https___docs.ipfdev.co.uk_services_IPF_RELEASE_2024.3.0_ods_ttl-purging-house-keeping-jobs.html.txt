TTL Purging Housekeeping jobs
Overview
Currently, we defined these housekeeping features that run every hour with initial delay of one minute:
Feature that ensures all data expires on the same day (if unitOfWork took more than a day to finish)
To enable it set
configured
sync-unit-of-works-expiry-date.enabled to true
If a unitOfWork started two days ago and finished today, expiresAt field for unitOfWorks collection will have the value of today + the value defined in _ts_1 Time-To-Live index expireAfterSeconds, but it could happen that records stored in other collections such as pds, payments, customObjects, processes and summaries are stored two or one day before so their expiresAt field value would be equal to today - (two or one day) + _ts_1 value.
This job would find such unitOfWorks and sync their
expiresAt
to have the same value across all collections.
Feature that postpones expiry of unfinished unitOfWorks that are expiring soon.
To enable it set
configured
postpone-expiry-of-unfinished-unit-of-works
This job finds all unfinished unitOfWorks that should expire in 1 to n days and n is defined in
configured
expires-in-max-days
and postpone to amount of days defined in
configured
document-ttl
.
This job updates
expiresAt
and
ttl
where
ttl
is used as a document level time-to-live value, and it is a way to override value from _ts_1 index if such index with and
expireAfterSeconds
index option is created.
The same as the previous feature but it looks for unarchived instead of unfinished unitOfWorks.
To enable it set
configured
postpone-expiry-of-unarchived-unit-of-works
Feature that creates a report consisting of number of unitOfWorks that will expire tomorrow.
To enable it set
configured
create-report-of-expiring-unit-of-works
