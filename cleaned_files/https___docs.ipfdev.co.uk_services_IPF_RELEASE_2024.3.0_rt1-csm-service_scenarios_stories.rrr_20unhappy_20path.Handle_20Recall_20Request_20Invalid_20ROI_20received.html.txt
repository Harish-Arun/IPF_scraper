the i12CSMi12  receives a Payment Cancellation Request
And
i12Recall Servicei12  receives a Technical Response with values:
| status | SUCCESS |
And
i12Recall Servicei12  receives a Send Recall To Csm Response
When
i12the CSMi12  sends an invalid Resolution Of Investigation
Then
i12CSMi12  receives a Payment Status Report using predicate:
| FIToFIPmtStsRpt.OrgnlGrpInf*And*Sts.GrpSts             | RJCT                                                  |

Then
i12the Payment Servicei12  receives a System Event using predicate:
| level                                 | ERROR                                     |
