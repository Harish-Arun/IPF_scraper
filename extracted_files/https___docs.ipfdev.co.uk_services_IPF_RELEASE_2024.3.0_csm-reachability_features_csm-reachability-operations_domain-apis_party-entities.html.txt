4. /party-entities
Purpose
Party Entities API can be used by client implementations to query the industry reference data for retrieving additional details of the parties involved on the payment. The details returned include other identifiers the party is known by, name and address details.
The details retrieved through /party-entities API can be used by client implementations for payment enrichment purposes.
Dynamic Configurations
The /party-entities API uses below dynamic configurations for retrieval of party entities.
Dynamic Configuration
Optionality
Purpose
Reference
Party Entity Directory
Mandatory
The Party Entity Directory holds the records loaded through Industry reference data and is the source of look ups for /party-entities API.
Party Entity Directory
IBAN Plus
Optional
IBANPlus Directory is needed if the client implementations want to use IBAN type identifiers for looking up the party entity records.
IBAN Plus Directory
IBAN Structure
Optional
IBAN Structure Directory is needed if the client implementations want to use IBAN type identifiers for looking up the party entity records.
IBAN Structure Directory
Exclusion List
Optional
IBAN Exclusion List is needed if the client implementations want to use IBAN type identifiers for looking up the party entity records.
Exclusion List Directory
Industry Reference Data
The Party Entity directory can be loaded through the industry data loads to enable the look-ups of party entity records. IPF CSM Reachability service supports ingestion of below industry reference data files to Party Entity Directory.
SWIFTRef Bank Directory Plus
SIX Bank Master
For more information on mapping from each industry reference data file into party entity directory, please refer

Usage
/party-entities API can be used by the client implementations to retrieve additional details about the parties involved on the payment for identifier / address enrichment of the payments.
Party entity look up is also used by other service implementations on CSM Reachability service to perform identifier look ups for reachability checks when the reachability requests do not have required identifiers as used by the CSM Agents for registering memberships on CSM Participants dynamic configuration.
Below CSM Reachability endpoints use party entities look up internally (Refer
CSM Reachability Operations
)

Request and Response
/party-entities follows below request and response structure. This section provides information on the request and response properties, for detailed API specs, please refer

API Version 2
Request
Request Property
Description
entityIdentifier
The identifier that should be used to look up the Entity record in the Party Entity Directory.
entityIdentifierType
The type of identifier being used for looking up an entity. Refer
Party Identifiers Explained
entityIdentifierSubType
1. The sub-type of the identifier type being used for look up.
2. For BIC type identifiers, both ACCOUNT_ISSUING_BIC and SCHEME_MEMBERSHIP_BIC values will lead to retrieval of the record identifier with matching BIC value.
3. Though party entity directory holds the NCC sub-type values as defined by respective industry data source (e.g. Bank Directory Plus), the /party-entities API supports the NCC sub-type values as defined under ISO20022 External Clearing System codes for look ups.
entityCountry
ISO3166-2 country code of the entity record being queried. entityCountry is required when querying records of type NCC and LEI.
entityDataSource
The industry data source that must be used for look up of the record on Party Entity Directory.
Response
Response Property
Description
entityUniqueId
The unique Id assigned to the entity as per the mapping from respective data source into Party Entity Directory.
entityDataSource
Industry / Custom data source that has been used for look up of the party entity record.
entityType
The type of the entity where available on Party Entity Directory.
entityName
Name of the entity as per the industry / custom data source.
entityAddress
Address of the entity as mapped from industry / custom data source. The address fields are aligned to ISO20022 specified address field format.
entityIdentifiers (*)
1. A list of identifiers derived from the Party Entity Directory. Multiple identifiers of same type can be registered against a record (in case of mergers) and multiple identifiers of different types can be returned if recorded on Party Entity directory.
2. Refer
Party Identifiers Explained
for more details on identifier types supported on CSM Reachability Service.
+identifier
The identifier value for the entity.
+IdentifierType
The type value associated with the entity identifier.
+identifierSubType
Subtype of the identifier type returned.
entityEmail
Email for the entity as recorded on Party Entity Directory.
entityPhoneNumber
The phone number for the entity as recorded on Party Entity Directory.
