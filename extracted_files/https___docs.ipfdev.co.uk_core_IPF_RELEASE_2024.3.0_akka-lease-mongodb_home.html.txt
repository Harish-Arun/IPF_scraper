Akka MongoDB Lease
This module enables IPF users to use MongoDB as a lease (distributed lock) provider. For more information about leases, see the
official Akka docs
.
When to Use
In an IPF context, you generally do not need to use a lease to ensure safety of clustered operations (singleton or shard creation, split brain resolver downing).
However, you should use this discovery method
only when all the following are true
:
IPF nodes are running in a multi DC setup on Kubernetes
Each DC runs its own Kubernetes cluster
IPF nodes form a single Akka Cluster
[
1
]
All Kubernetes clusters can access the same MongoDB instance
If IPF is running in a multi-DC environment, but the DCs belong to a single Kubernetes cluster, you should use the
official Kubernetes API lease
.
1
. Requires all nodes to be reachable by other nodes, either by running on a routeable pod network or via nodePort
How do you create a reusable flow module?
