Get Next Execution Date
This function will take the date input and validate it as an execution date but if it is invalid, roll forward until a valid execution date is determined.
Once the date is valid (i.e. not in the past and a valid business date for the scheme, as determined by the
calendarId
) then it will return the revised Execution Date and calculate the Settlement Date using the revised Execution Date
