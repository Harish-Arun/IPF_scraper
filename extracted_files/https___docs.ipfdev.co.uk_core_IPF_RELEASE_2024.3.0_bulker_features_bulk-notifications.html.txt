Bulk Notifications
The Bulker sends the following notifications:
BulkArchivedNotification
BulkClosedNotification
BulkCompletedNotification
BulkConfiguredNotification
BulkFinalisedNotification
BulkRejectedNotification
BulkTerminatedNotification
ChildBulkRegisteredNotification
These notifications are sent when the bulk is in the relevant state.
There are three options for handling Bulk Notifications
Embedded Bulk Notification Handling
Send Bulk Notifications to an external system using Connectors
Send Bulk Notifications using in built support for sending notifications to Kafka
Embedded Bulk Notification Handling
Add the following dependency:
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.iconsolutions.ipf.bulk</groupId>
    <artifactId>ipf-bulker-notifications-api</artifactId>
</dependency>
And then provide an implementation of
BulkNotificationPort
, adding it as a bean to the Application Context.
Sending Bulk Notifications via Connectors
To send notifications to an external system, add the following dependency, which includes a Connector for sending Bulker Notifications.
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.iconsolutions.ipf.bulk</groupId>
    <artifactId>ipf-bulker-notifications-connector-core</artifactId>
</dependency>
Then define a specific
ConnectorTransport<BulkNotification<?>>
bean in the application context (supported ConnectorTransports include Kafka, HTTP and JMS). Please see
Writing HTTP Connector
for an example of configuring a HTTPConnectorTransport and wiring the ConnectorTransport into the Connector.
Sending Bulk Notifications to Kafka
To send notifications to a kafka topic, instead of including the above dependency, include the dependency below. Using the dependency below, means support for sending the notifications for Kafka is preconfigured.
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.iconsolutions.ipf.bulk</groupId>
    <artifactId>ipf-bulker-notifications-connector-kafka</artifactId>
</dependency>
