Core improvements, bug fixes & changes
New
IPF Processing Data
Version 2 of the IPF Processing Data model has been introduced. Specifications for both the V2 and V1 data models can be found
here
.
The IPF Processing Data Egress plugins are set, by default, to export the V2 data model version. Only one version will be exported for any given application that uses the egress plugins. However, you can configure the plugins to use the V1 data model if necessary using
ipf.processing-data.egress.schema-version = 1
.
IPF Processing Data Ingress plugins can consume both the V2 and V1 data model at the same time. The implementing application should provide a handler for the new data model. See the
migration guide
for further details
Changed
Connector
:
when an ActorSystem is not passed to a connector, an error message is logged instead of a warning message
all Send/Receive connectors' builders use debug logging level when dependency is not provide and default one is used
all Send/Receive connectors' builders use debug logging level when configuration parameter is not provide and default one is used
all Send/Receive connectors' builders use the same logging message formatter
Fixed
dot-compiler
maven plugin - updated dependency version to address the issue with flow builds on Windows (j2v8 engine fails to parse a file); the new version is absorbed in
connector
,
flo-lang
(used in tiles), and
ipf-release-management

Example of building a
MdsObjectWrapper

    return new MdsObjectWrapper<>(container.getObjectType(), container.getObject());
}

Message Logs produced by the Notification Service app utilise the V2 IPF Processing Data Model. To remain on the V1 model set
ipf.processing-data.egress.schema-version = 1
.
Human Task Manager
New
HTM will now publish all the new domain events to IPF Processing Data and to ODS by default.
To disable events being sent, add
ipf.journal.exporter.type = none
to your
application.conf
In case you wish to export all of HTM domain events from the beginning of history, you can do so by adding
event-processor.start-stream-from = EARLIEST
to your
application.conf
.
Please note that this option is only available if you are not using delegated event processors. For more details, see the
HTM event processor docs
Added HTM Task Purging feature to allow purging items from
task
and
task-history
collections.
TTL Indexes are created by default for both MongoDB and Azure CosmosDB for MongoDB, and they are needed for purging.
Please look at
HTM Task Purging
documentation for more details on how to configure HTM for supported DBs.
Changed
Global States (ACCEPTED, CANCELLED) removed from the Task Manager flow.
This has been done in order to prevent ODS (Inquiry) marking a UnitOfWork as complete when actually it’s not.

Added filtering by currency for check payment risk endpoint
