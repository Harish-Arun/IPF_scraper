Processing
IPF contains a number of features within the core which are optionally used depending on your solution requirements. This section covers those which are related to core processing.
IPF Cache - this module provides a simple Caffeine backed caching interface that IPF solutions can use for in memory caching (also see
Transaction Caching
for transaction specific caching, especially where a long lived persistent cache is required).
Persistent Scheduler - scheduling future processing and jobs is covered by this component and works with cron expressions in combination with calendars to execute one-time or recurrent jobs. It also features a persistence layer whose main role is to keep single source of truth.
Dynamic Settings - Dynamic Processing Settings provides a platform to manage configurable settings and their lifecycle.
Bulk File Processing - the modules here provide the capability to process bulks of transactions or records, streamed from or to files.
Message Logger - module and interface to allow the logging and/or publishing of IPF processing data.
Payments Notification Service - an application that produces Payment Status Notifications, based Domain Events from IPF processing.
