IPF Bulker
"The ability to aggregate payment instructions into one or more bulk files, each containing multiple transactions, potentially between multiple debtors and creditors."
If an IPF implementation needs to store a collection of data elements in a structured file format, the Bulker will provide this functionality.
The individual features and characteristics of the Bulker are covered in the Concepts page.
