At the first negative check the system stops and sends a message to the Originator Participant, Ancillary System or Instructing Party acting on behalf of the Originator Participant or a Reachable Party â same DN of the Sender in step 1 â containing the proper error code.
If the failed check is âTimeout Check - Originator Sideâ, the status of the transaction is set to âExpiredâ; in all the other cases, the status is set to âFailedâ.

TIPS
TIPS infers the account to be debited from the configured accounts information, the Originator Participant BIC and the currency of the Instant Payment transaction. In details TIPS checks that:
an account, with either type "TIPS Account" or âTIPS AS Technical Accountâ exists,
it is linked to the Originator Participant (field "Originator BIC") as authorised user,
and it is denominated in the same currency as the one defined in the Settlement Amount.
If the check does not return any account, TIPS looks for a CMB linked to the Originator Participant (field "Originator BIC") as authorised user;
TIPS selects the account linked to the CMB; the account related to the CMB must be denominated in the same currency as the one defined in the Settlement Amount.
From now on, the selected account is referred to as "Originator Account" and the possible CMB as "Debiting CMB".

TIPS
TIPS infers the account to be credited from the configured accounts information, the Beneficiary Participant BIC and the currency of the Instant Payment transaction. In details TIPS checks that:

it is linked to the Beneficiary Participant (field "Beneficiary BIC" ) as authorised user,
and has a currency equal to the one defined in the Settlement Amount.
If the check does not return any account, TIPS looks for a CMB linked to the Beneficiary Participant (field "Beneficiary BIC") as authorised user;
