IPF File Poller Scheduler
This provides a scheduler that is polling the files from a configured location(s). Based on some configured accepted patterns it is filtering the files. The scheduler is checking if a file was previously processed by keeping track on the file name, hashed metadata, and hashed content.

notify File Poller Adapter
If the file is new, or it has been modified, the File Poller Adapter is notified. The file poller is doing this by setting up a scheduler, The schedulerId will be saved in the database.
If a file has been modified and there is already a scheduled job, the job will be cancelled and another job schedule will be created for a fresh guard window. This allows for files that are in the process of being copied but have not completed, to be picked up only when they have finished and the content is no longer changed during the guard window.
Configuration
The base config is
ipf.file-poller.pollers
and it takes a list of pollers to allow polling from multiple directories. This allows polling to be split across processing entities where each entity would be configured to read from a separate directory.
