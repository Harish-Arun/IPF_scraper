1. Update your maven dependency plugin executions
Add the below
unpack-ipf-business-functions-plugin
execution to the
maven-dependency-plugin
build plugin included within your
mps
module. If your project was generated using the IPF Archetype this will be a submodule of
<your-project-name>-domain
.
<execution>
    <id>unpack-ipf-business-functions-plugin</id>
    <phase>initialize</phase>
    <goals>
        <goal>unpack</goal>
    </goals>
    <configuration>
        <artifactItems>
            <artifactItem>
                <groupId>com.iconsolutions.ipf.businessfunctions.aggregator.domain</groupId>
