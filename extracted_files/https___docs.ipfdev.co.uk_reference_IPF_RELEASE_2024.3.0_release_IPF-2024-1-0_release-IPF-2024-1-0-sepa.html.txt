In the new release, Bulker now passivates bulks after 2 minutes by default. It has been identified that there are some issues when rehydrating actors after passivation has occurred. This will be fixed in the next release. To mitigate this in the current release, it is recommended to increase the bulker passivation timeout to a larger value than what you would expect the bulk to close. For Example, if the largest bulk window is 4 hours, it is recommended to set the value below to at least this value or even higher in your application.conf file:
ipf.bulker.aggregate.actor-idle-timeout = 5h
