UTILS4 - Fraud Simulator
This document covers how to use the fraud simulator. There are two recommended approaches for the tutorial, both docker and non-docker. Letâ€™s look at these:
Using the Application Through Docker
Below provides a simple docker file entry for the developer application:
fraud-sim:
    image: registry.ipf.iconsolutions.com/sample-systems-fraud-simulator-http:2.1.46
    container_name: fraud-sim
    environment:
      - FRAUD_SIM_ENCRYPTION_ENABLED=FALSE
    ports:
      - 8089:8080
      - 8090:55555
    volumes:
      - ./config/fraud-sim:/fraud-simulator-http/conf
      - ./logs:/ipf/logs
    user: "${UID:-1000}:${GID:-1000}"
The fraud simulator requires no specialised configuration beyond the defaults. When executed the fraud-simulator will listen for data on port 55555 on the docker network. This is mapped to port 8090 on the host machine. The logs will be exported to logs/fraud-sim.app-log relative to the docker file.
Using the Application without Docker
Prerequisites
To run this simulator requires:
A Java 17 runtime
Configuration
Property
Description
Default Value
simulator.http.port
Defines the port upon which to listen for http requests.
55555
server.port
Defines the port the application will run on
8080
The fraud, payment-initiation and sanctions simulator will all listen on port 55555, so when running together on one host it is important to override the properties to give them unique ports.
Download
The fraud simulator is available here:
nexus.ipf.iconsolutions.com/repository/ipf-releases/com/iconsolutions/ipf/sample/samplesystems/fraud-simulator-http/2.1.46/fraud-simulator-http-2.1.46-runnable.jar
Running
Once downloaded, place it into this directory and run:
java -cp "fraud-simulator-http-2.1.46-runnable.jar:config" -D"loader.main"="com.iconsolutions.samplesystems.fraud.simulator.FraudSimulatorHttpApplication" "org.springframework.boot.loader.launch.PropertiesLauncher"
The application will then start and be available from:
localhost:55555/index.html
Note that on Windows, the colon in the run command should be replaced by a semicolon.
