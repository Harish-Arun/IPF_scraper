Navigation
The navigation service gets all the routes that have been registered to the app and returns them as an array. It is used
for the navigation from the module tiles on the home page. It also maps the translations for the title and description of each module tile.
You can exclude a route by adding the data property of
excludeFromIpfNav: true
to the route.
Example:
{
    path: 'example-route-to-show',
    component: ExampleRouteComponent
},
{
    path: 'example-route-to-hide',
    component: ExampleRouteComponent,
    data: { excludeFromIpfNav: true }
},
An example of how the service is used can be seen
