Agent Clearing Settings
Agent Clearing Settings are the configurations for an Agent that can be used for clearing of the payment messsages between the Processing Entity and the Agent. These settings are independent of the transfer currency and do not concern with actual settlement. Agent Clearing Settings are optional configurations and should be set up when these are required against an Agent.
