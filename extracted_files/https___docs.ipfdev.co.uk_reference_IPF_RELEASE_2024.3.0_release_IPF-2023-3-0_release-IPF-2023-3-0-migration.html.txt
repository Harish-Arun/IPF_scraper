Migration Steps for IPF-2023.3.0
Version Updates
New IPF Data Model Migration
You will need to migrate to the new data model before updating to the new BOM (if not done migrating to 2023.2.0). We will be deprecating and removing the old types in subsequent releases.
Details can be found in the IPF Developer Docs -
Migrating from legacy data model

Update all the flo versions within the domain folders to
