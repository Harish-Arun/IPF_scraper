Getting Started
Quick Start
Choose your metrics
Some metrics are enabled by default and will work without any additional configuration, such as the count of finished payments, end-to-end payment duration, and error codes.
Other metrics, such as payment critical path duration and payment waiting duration, will require additional configuration before they’re enabled and working as you expect.
See the
Payment Metrics
for more information.
Choose your labels
Metrics will be labelled by default, but some labels require additional configuration for them to work as you expect. Any labels that are not enabled because they’re not configured will still be applied to metrics, but the value is always
Unknown
.
Error code metrics
contain a single label representing the error code, and there are no additional labels for you to configure
Payment metrics can have many different labels
, some of them enabled and working by default, with others requiring additional configuration for them to be enabled.
Configure and Run
See the
Deployment Options
page for more information.
Test
Once IPF Metrics Processor is running, and there are no obvious errors in the logs, you can query the
/actuator/prometheus
HTTP endpoint to see if it is producing metrics.
There shouldn’t be any business metrics yet (metrics prefixed with
businessmetrics_
), unless the
IPF_PROCESSING_DATA
contained payment data.
Once IPF Metrics Processor has processed payment data, you should see business metrics, e.g.
$ curl localhost:8080/actuator/prometheus | grep businessmetrics
... snip ...
# HELP businessmetrics_payments_finished_total
# TYPE businessmetrics_payments_finished_total counter
businessmetrics_payments_finished_total{csm="TIPS",currency="EUR",direction="Internal",htm="No",paymentType="DebtorCT",state="Completed",} 31.0
businessmetrics_payments_finished_total{csm="TIPS",currency="EUR",direction="Internal",htm="No",paymentType="DebtorCT",state="Cancelled",} 46.0
... snip ...
