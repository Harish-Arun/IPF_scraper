Calendars
A Calendar is a mechanism that is used for excluding blocks of time regardless of the time specification
that was supplied. For example, if a job is set to run once a day, it is possible to augment this specification with a
calendar to say that it should only run once a day on weekdays, for example. More information is available
here
.
If a calendar is not provided as part of the
JobSpecification
, then the default calendar is used.
To define a default calendar, the configuration file has to contain
ipf.persistent-scheduler.quartz.calendars.default
and
ipf.persistent-scheduler.quartz.calendars
as in example below.
If no default calendar is configured, then the scheduler will not use calendars and the cron expression will be honoured
without exclusions.
ipf.persistent-scheduler.quartz.calendars.default = "DefaultCalendar"

ipf.persistent-scheduler {
  quartz {
    calendars {
      DefaultCalendar {
        type = Annual
        description = "Default calendar"
        exclude-dates = ["12-25", "01-01"]
      }
    }
  }
}
Calendar Types
Quartz calendars can be of the following types:
Calendar type name
Description
Example
Daily
Exclude blocks of time from a day with a timezone. Use
UTC
or the list of timezones
here
.
exclude {
    start-time = "03:00"
    end-time = "05:00"
}
timezone = UTC
Monthly
Exclude days from a month
exclude-days = [1, 3, 5, 7]
Weekly
Exclude days of the week from a week.  Days are 1-indexed and start on Sunday, i.e. Sunday = 1, Monday = 2, etc.
exclude-days = [1, 7] //will exclude the weekend
Cron
Exclude by a custom cron expression
exclude-expression = * * 0-7,18-23 ? * *
Holiday
Exclude explicit dates (useful for
moveable feasts
like Easter or UK bank holidays) in ISO 8601
yyyy-MM-dd
format
exclude-dates = ["2024-03-31", "2025-04-20"] //excludes Easter 2024 and 2025
Annual
Exclude calendar dates from each year in
MM-DD
format
exclude-dates = ["01-01", "25-12"] //excludes New Yearâ€™s Day and Christmas Day every year
A job can only use one calendar.
