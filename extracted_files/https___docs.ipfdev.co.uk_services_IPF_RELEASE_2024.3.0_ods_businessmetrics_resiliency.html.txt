Resiliency
The IPF Metrics Processor may need to fetch additional data from ODS for a particular payment. This is likely to occur upon application restart where only a subset of the data needed to determine if a payment has finished is consumed by the IPF Metrics Processor; therefore no metrics can be emitted. In this scenario, the IPF Metrics Processor fetches data from ODS to attempt to "finish" the payment and emit the subsequent metrics.
Caveats
The IPF Metrics Processor does not utilise its own persistent data store, therefore there are a small number of instances where payment metrics cannot be produced.
ODS cannot provide enough data to "finish" payment
There is a small possibility that when called upon, ODS has not yet consumed all the necessary payment data to determine that a payment has finished. In this case, no metrics for this payment can be emitted and a warning is logged upon the expiration of the payment from the in memory cache.
Receive additional payment data after emitting metric and expiring from cache
There is a possibility that metrics can be emitted multiple times for a single payment. This will only occur in the following situation:
Payment data has been consumed by the metrics processor and metrics have been emitted
The payment is expired from the metrics processor in memory cache (default expiration is 10 minutes)
Additional data is consumed for that particular payment. The metrics processor will consider this additional data to be a completely new payment and will emit a duplicate metric
The likeliness for this to occur is quite low, there would need to be a long delay between a payment being finished and more data being consumed for that payment.
