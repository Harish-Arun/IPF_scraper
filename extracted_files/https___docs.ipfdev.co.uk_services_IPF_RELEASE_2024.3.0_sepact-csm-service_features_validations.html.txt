Validations
SEPA CT STEP2 CSM Service supports below validations on the bulks submitted from Client implementation flows. it is important to note that some validations may not be applicable based on the source of request. (Refer individual features to understand applicable validations).
The scheme rules are identified and referenced from scheme documentation (STEP2 SCT Interface Specifications, STEP2 SCT Functional Description).
All message types will have a schema check performed using the current version of the xsd. This action will perform all the necessary technical checks on the message such as data types, cardinality and size of data elements. As well as these Technical checks, the SEPA CSM performs Business-level checks, to ensure the data input to each field conforms to any rules over and above the basic Technical checks (eg settlement date is no more than three working days in advance, any ISO codes are valid for the particular use or calculated totals are equal to the counts they relate to).
Messages arriving from the scheme will receive a technical check against their xsd. The only Business level validations to take place will make sure they are;
not duplicates (file or individual transactions),
intended for the Direct Participant running the instance of SEPA CT CSM and their configured Regional Brands,
containing address formats that have been correctly used (either structured, unstructured or scheme allowed combinations of the two).
Inbound messages from the scheme that fail validations, will still be passed to the client, however they will be added to a dedicated kafka topic that should be routed to an exception processing implementation. The SEPA CT scheme pack does not have a mechanism for the automated rejection of an inbound message.
Business Level Validations
Debtor CT (pacs.008 Bulks)
Message / Bulk Level Validations:
Duplicate check
Group Header Totals Checks
Interbank Settlement Amount check
Number of transactions check
Scheme Rules Checks against the Group Header Fields
Instructing Agent BICS are correct and do not include branch codes
Clearing system correct
Settlement Date Validations
The Interbank settlement date submitted on the bulks is validated against the allowed date range from Scheme’s point of view. STEP2 SCT service allows the transactions with the current settlement date and up to 3 future valid Target2 Business days to be submitted on the bulks.
If the Interbank Settlement date submitted on the bulks to the STEP2 SCT CSM Service are outside this range, the CSM Service will reject this bulk to avoid a rejection of the bulk from the scheme.
The settlement date calculations take into account the "SCT EOD Real Time Validation Cut-Off" configuration. Any bulks that are submitted to the CSM Service with the same calendar date but after the cut-off time, will be rejected. (Refer Configurations)
Transaction Validations:
Duplicate Check
Scheme Rules Checks at transaction level
Payment Service code is 'SEPA'
Category Purpose Code is set to correct value and any associated fields are correct
Debtor Agent is present
Any Country Codes used are valid ISO codes
Addresses populated when Beneficiary PSP is located in a non-EEA country or territory
Only valid country code combinations for Creditor and Debtor agents are used
Remittance Information field used correctly
Schema Checks of mapped EBA Scheme format messages (before submitting for bulking)
Creditor CT (pacs.004 Bulks)
Message / Bulk Level Validations:
Duplicate check at bulk (message) level
Group Header Totals Checks
Interbank Settlement Amount check
Number of transactions check
Scheme Rules Checks against the Group Header Fields
Instructing Agent BICS are correct and do not include branch codes
Clearing system correct
Settlement Date Validations
The Interbank settlement date submitted on the bulks is validated against the allowed date range from Scheme’s point of view. STEP2 SCT service allows the transactions with the current settlement date and up to 1 future valid Target2 Business days to be submitted on the bulks.
Transaction Validations:
Duplicate Check at transaction level
Scheme Rules Checks at transaction level
Correct Payment Service code
Category Purpose Code is set to correct value and any associated fields are correct
Creditor Agent is present
Any Country Codes used are valid ISO codes
Return Reason code is a valid ISO code
Additional Information used when appropriate
Schema Checks of mapped EBA Scheme format messages (before submitting for bulking)
Debtor CT (pacs.004 Bulks)
Returns of a previously sent pacs.008 can not be rejected. If they were, there would be no legitimate account for the funds to be credited to. A bank receiving a pacs.004 has to process it in some way (by crediting the originator of the pacs.008 or a suspense account pending investigation). For this reason, only technical checks, a duplicate check and Debtor BIC checks are performed, no further fields are validated.
Creditor CT (camt.029 Bulks)

Scheme Rules Checks against the Group Header Fields
Instructing Agent BICS are correct and do not include branch codes
Clearing system correct
Transaction Validations:
Duplicate Check at transaction level
Schema Checks of mapped EBA Scheme format messages (before submitting for bulking)
Debtor CT (camt.056)

Message / Bulk Level Validations:
Original message name and correct use of Original Group Information
Duplicate check at bulk (message) level
Instructing Agent BICS are correct and do not include branch codes
