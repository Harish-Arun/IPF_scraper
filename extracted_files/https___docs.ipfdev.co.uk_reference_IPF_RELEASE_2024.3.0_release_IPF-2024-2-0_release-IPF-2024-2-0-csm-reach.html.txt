CSM Reachability - Changes & Fixes
This page covers the CSM Reachability V2 improvements, changes and fixes provided in release IPF-2024.2.0.
CSM Reachability and Industry Data Ingestion
New
csm-reachability-file-ingestion
with the
csm-reachability-file-ingestion-api
module and the support for ingesting files from aws s3 bucket (
csm-reachability-file-ingestion-s3
).
Topic name to send file available notification is
FILE_AVAILABLE_NOTIFICATION
Topic name to receive file processed notification is
FILE_PROCESSED_NOTIFICATION
The purpose of this is that we are now able to read and process files located on an aws s3 bucket instance.
csm-reachability-file-ingestion-notification-service
module with
csm-reachability-file-ingestion-notification-service-core
containing message types and kafka support (
csm-reachability-file-ingestion-notification-service-kafka
).
It is possible now to receive a kafka message saying the file is available for processing on the s3 bucket,
trigger the file processing mechanism, and send the message to kafka if needed, saying the file has been processed (successfully or not).
Send Connector for sending
FileProcessedNotification
message to a specified Kafka topic
Receive Connector for receiving
FileAvailableNotification
message
FileAvailableNotificationHandler
for handling FileAvailableNotification, triggering file processing  and optionally acknowledging whether processing is successful or failed.
FileEntryProcessedEvent
is raised for each file entry processed.
Changed
In
ProcessingFailedEvent
name
field is renamed to
processName
, because now we have field called
fileName
, and this
processName
is more descriptive than just
name
.
Bank Directory Plus load to Party Entity correctly maps
identifierSubType
when proper correlation between
iso_country_code
and
field_b
exists in input file. Mapping is configurable with property
ipf.csm-reachability.data-ingestion.bank-directory.mappings
Absorbed
connector
and
flo-lang
changes which will together with configuration changes improve memory and time consumption during file ingestion.
When csm-reachability data ingestion fails, the message level is now error (was previously info) and the message includes the filename.
Configuration
ipf.csm-reachability.file-ingestion-notification-service.directory-ids
directory id config properties for ingested files from s3 bucket on path
ipf.csm-reachability.data-ingestion.bank-directory.mappings
mapping from field_b to identifierSubType for Bank Directory Plus load to Party Entity
ipf.csm-reachability.file-ingestion.s3.enabled
property to enable S3 file ingestion. Default value is false.
ipf.file-manager.s3.resiliency-settings.max-attempts
Determines the maximum number of retries to be made. Note that this includes the first failed attempt. Default value is 2.
ipf.file-manager.s3.resiliency-settings.retryable-status-codes
Retry if HTTP error code is in the list. Default value is [500, 503]
ipf.file-manager.s3.resiliency-settings.attempt-timeout
Default value is 2s.
ipf.file-manager.s3.resiliency-settings.call-timeout
Default value is 3s.
ipf.file-manager.s3.endpoint-url
S3 endpoint url
ipf.file-manager.s3.region
S3 region
ipf.file-manager.s3.credentials.access-key-id
S3 Credentials
ipf.file-manager.s3.credentials.secret-access-key
S3 Credentials
ipf.file-manager.s3.path-style-requests
Path style request
CSM Reachability API
New
V2 API introduced with prefix
/api/v2
Previous version of API is no longer supported
Swagger UI is available at url
host:port/swagger-ui/index.html
Swagger UI updated with valid descriptions and examples
New endpoint
/v2/validate-intra-entity-reachability
added which is used to verify if counter-party is reachable via processing entity (OnUs) so there is no need to send transfer via external agent or CSM.
Added new attribute entityCountry in IbanServiceResponseDto for /V2/iban-deconstruct response. It is mapped from the attribute isoCountryCode on IBAN Plus Dynamic configuration.
Api connector configuration is added, and it follows the ipf naming standard. Each connector inherits from default connector configuration and can override it for its own purpose. Default configuration is under
ipf.csm-reachability-api.default-connector
, and for each existing connector, configuration is under
ipf.csm-reachability-api.connector.<connector-name>
New enum value PARTICIPANT_COUNTRY for appliedLimitCategory in ValidateScmReachability and SelectCsmAgent responses.
participantCountryLimits in AgentSettlementSettings response
new field named
agentCountry
as a part of AccountServicingAgent in Agent Settlement Settings
Changed
Api connector transport configuration is now changed to match the ipf naming standard, but is still backward compatible with the old naming.
Configuration property prefix
csm-reachability-api
is changed to
ipf.csm-reachability-api
For
/party-entities
GET endpoint
entityDataSource
parameter is now mandatory, required on GetPartyEntitiesCriteria.
When identifier is BIC, identifierSubType will be ignored during the Party Entity LookUp
IbanServiceResponseDto is changed to support multiple entityIdentifiers. Removed ibanBic, sortCode and headOfficeIid from the response, and added ibanCountry and list of entityIdentifiers (BIC or NCC).
Iban deconstruct can handle countries that don’t issue national ids
Configuration
ipf.csm-reachability-api.default-connector
default connector configuration
ipf.csm-reachability-api.connector.<connector-name>
configuration of a specific connector
CSM Reachability
New
CsAgentSelectionSettings - added selectionId as a searchable field
IbanPlus - added new attribute isoCountryCode. Logical unique key now is updated and it’s consisted of isoCountryCode + ibanIsoCountryCode + nationalId fields.
Dps connector configuration is added, and it follows the ipf naming standard. Each connector inherits from default connector configuration and can override it for its own purpose. Default configuration is under
ipf.csm-reachability.settings-api.default-connector
, and for each existing connector, configuration is under
ipf.csm-reachability.settings-api.connector.<connector-name>
.
When the Party Entities API is called with a specific data source, multiple records can now be retrieved. In this scenario, we will return a new reason code with the description:
Multiple party entity records match on Party Entity Directory for specified identifier value. Reachability request can be re-run including the identifier type used for membership by the Agent for accurate results
.
participantCountryLimits - new type of limit se on AgentSettlementSettings related to participant country
DPS - new field named
agentCountry
as a part of AccountServicingAgent in Agent Settlement Settings. New field is mandatory when agent identifier type is NCC or LEI
when /select-csm-agent endpoint is called and in the request we have returnEnhancedCSMData as true, agentCountry is mapped into the response. Also, when /settlement-agent endpoint is called and isIncludeSettlementSettings as a true in the request, agentCountry is mapped into the response.
New
AgentCountryPattern
which doesn’t allow that new field
agentCountry
is not set when we have at least 1 agent identifier type which is NCC or LEI
Changed
All properties, related to setting save history, are changed to match IPF standard, but are still backward compatible with the old naming. Old naming is deprecated and scheduled for removal in future releases.
Dps connector transport configuration is now changed to match the ipf naming standard, but is still backward compatible with the old naming. Deprecated configuration will be scheduled for removal in future releases.
When matching entity identifiers on party entity lookup,
identifierSubType
is used together with
identifierType
if supplied
IbanServiceResponseDto is changed to support multiple entityIdentifiers. Removed ibanBic, sortCode and headOfficeIid from the response, and added ibanCountry and list of entityIdentifiers (BIC or NCC).
EntityCountry is mapped as ISO Country code from Iban Plus record.
IbanCountry is mapped as IBAN ISO Country code from Iban Plus record.
BIC value is now mapped as one of the identifiers if we have ibanBic on the ibanPlus record, and the subtype is mapped as SCHEME_MEMBERSHIP_BIC.
NCC value can be mapped as IBAN National ID or as IBAN National ID (without the 4 character SWIFT Bank Code), and the subtype is mapped if the ibanCountry has corresponding ISO Country Code mapping.
Party entity service is now using an IBAN deconstructed identifier with BIC type if the entityDataSource on the criteria is Bank_Directory_Plus, otherwise it is using NCC identifier for look-up.
Validate intra entity reachability service is using an IBAN deconstructed identifier with BIC type if it is specified on IntraEntityParties record, otherwise it is using NCC identifier as CounterPartyIdentifier.
Validate csm entity reachability service is using an IBAN deconstructed identifier with BIC type if it is specified on ParticipationDetails on AgentSettings record, otherwise it is using NCC identifier as CounterPartyIdentifier.
Validate CSM Reachability and Select CSM Agent - participant country match removed from participant lookup
