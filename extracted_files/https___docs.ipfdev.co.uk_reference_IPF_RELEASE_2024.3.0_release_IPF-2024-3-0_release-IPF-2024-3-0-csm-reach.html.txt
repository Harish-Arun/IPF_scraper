CSM Reachability - Changes & Fixes
This page covers the CSM Reachability V2 improvements, changes and fixes provided in release IPF-2024.3.0.
CSM Reachability and Industry Data Ingestion
Changed
During file ingestion,file names and extensions are not case-sensitive anymore.
Data Ingestion
Changed
Due to bug fixes in the connector-file library, all
ipf.csm-reachability.*.file-ingestion.interval
configuration properties should now be set in seconds, rather than minutes or hours.
The bug fixes ensure that ingesters will no longer mistakenly pick up the same file during each polling cycle while it is being processed.
CSM Reachability now includes default directory structures for the ingestion of supported industry data files.
Each industry file now has a default, dedicated path, removing the requirement of each deployment to provide their own overrides.
Default ingestion paths can still be customized if needed, existing overrides will still apply.
For more details, refer to the
CSM Reachability Data Ingestion Configuration Reference
page.
Default
ipf.csm-reachability.*.file-ingestion.interval
is reduced, from
1h
to
30s
. All existing
file-ingestion.interval
overrides can now be safely removed.
Directory mapping from MongoDB
directory-mapping
collection is deprecated. It requires migration to
ipf.file-ingestion.directory-mapping
HOCON configuration that should be used instead.
Please ensure you follow the appropriate instructions
