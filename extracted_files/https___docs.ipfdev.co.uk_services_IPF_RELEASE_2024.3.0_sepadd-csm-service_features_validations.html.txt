Validations
Validation API
SEPA DD STEP2 CSM Service provides a Validation API to enable the Client Implementation flows or SDK clients to submit the bulks for validation purposes only. The request to the API does not lead to the bulks being submitted for Collecting and Settlement.
The response from the Direct Debit Validation API is
Direct Debit Validation API
which can comprise a message level OrgnlGrpInfAndSts block, transaction level TxInfAndSts block(s) and (if requested) a schemeFormatMessage block.
Validate Direct Debit Scheme Rules
The Direct Debit Scheme Rules API rule carries out the validations on the submitted bulks and included transactions and provides a validation response. Below validations are performed:
Message Level Validation (Bulk level validations)
Validation of Group Header totals such as Count of transactions and Interbank Settlement Amounts.
Scheme Rules Validations against the Header fields
Mapping from the IPF Canonical format message to the Scheme format message
Individual Transaction Validations and Scheme Rule Validations
Schema Check of the final validations
The Validations API can return the Scheme format message in the response if requested in the request if the 'returnSchemeMessage' flag is set to True. The transactions that fail the validations will be removed from the format message so the output scheme format message will always be acceptable by the scheme. When removing the failed transactions, the CSM service will adjust the group header totals (count of transactions and amounts), so they match the transactions that have passed validations. The scheme does not alter the contents of individual transactions in any shape or form so the transactions transparency is always maintained.
Please note that below validations are not performed when the bulks are submitted to the Validation API.
Duplicate check on the submitted bulks
Duplicate check at transaction level
Validations against the settlement dates submitted on the bulks
The duplicate checks are not performed on the Validation API call. This is to ensure the same bulk can be submitted multiple times for validation without being rejected as duplicate in later attempts or when it is eventually submitted for clearing and settlement.
Interbank Settlement date Validations are not performed keeping in mind that the submission to Validation API is not same as request to collect and settle and that the dates on the transactions may be updated when they are finally submitted for clearing.

Direct Debit Validation API
Request Processing API
SEPA DD STEP2 CSM Service supports below validations on bulks submitted from Client implementation flows. It is important to note that some validations may not be applicable based on the source of request. (Refer to individual features to understand applicable validations).
The scheme rules are identified and referenced from scheme documentation (STEP2 SDD Interface Specifications, STEP2 SDD Functional Description).
All message types will have a schema check performed using the current version of the scheme xsd. This action will perform all the necessary technical checks on the message such as data types, cardinality and size of data elements. As well as these Technical checks, the SEPA CSM performs Business-level checks, to ensure the data input to each field conforms to any rules over and above the basic Technical checks (e.g. settlement date is no more than 14 working days in advance, any ISO codes are valid for the particular use or calculated totals are equal to the counts they relate to).
Messages arriving from the scheme will receive a technical check against their xsd. The only Business level validations to take place will make sure they are:
Not duplicates (file or individual transactions)
Intended for the Direct Participant running the instance of SEPA DD CSM and their configured Regional Brands
Containing address formats that have been correctly used (either structured, unstructured or scheme allowed combinations of the two)
Inbound messages from the scheme that fail validations, will still be passed to the client, however they will be added to a dedicated kafka topic that should be routed to an exception processing implementation. The SEPA DD scheme pack does not have a mechanism for the automated rejection of an inbound message.
