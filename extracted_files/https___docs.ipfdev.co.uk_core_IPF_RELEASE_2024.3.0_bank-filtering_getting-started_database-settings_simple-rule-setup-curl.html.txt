Rule
The dynamic configurations required for Bank filtering can be set up using DPS Setting management APIs directly.
Filtering rule is stored in next format:
Field name
Mandatory
Data type
Description
requiresApproval
Mandatory
boolean
Does request need to be approved
createdBy
Mandatory
string
Rule creator name
source
Mandatory
string
Rule source
activeFromDate
Mandatory
timestamp
Datetime when rule starts to be applied
processingEntity
Mandatory
string
A processing entity defines a sub-organization within an organization. A dedicated bank exclusion/blocking list can be defined for each sub-organization. Processing Entity is part of Dynamic Processing Setting (DPS) SettingDTO which is the superclass of BankFilteringRule, and is therefore not part of the payload.
payload
Mandatory
object
Rule specific settings
payload.ruleId
Mandatory
string
Rule ID
payload.ruleName
Mandatory
string
Short rule name
payload.ruleDescription
Mandatory
string
A comprehensive rule description
payload.csmAgentIds
Optional
list of strings
A list of CSM Agent IDs that identifies a CSM for which a bank exclusion list applies
payload.country
Optional
string
A country filter used to be matched against country code, extracted from input BIC (5. and 6. character in BIC)
payload.currency
Optional
string
Currency filter used to be matched against input currency. (Exact matching)
payload.bic
Optional
string
BIC filter used to be matched against input BIC. (Exact matching or starts with). It can be 4, 6, 8 or 11 characters long.
payload.ncc
Optional
object
NCC filter used to be matched against input NCC.
payload.ncc.nccValue
Optional
list of strings
List of string values used for NCC filtering.
payload.ncc.Country
Optional
string
NCC country used for NCC filtering.
payload.direction
Mandatory
enum
DEBTOR
CREDITOR
ANY
A direction determines transactions to exclude based on whether a matched BIC is a debtor agent BIC, a creditor agent BIC, or any of them. Direction field does not have default value
payload.startDate
Optional
datetime
Optional field, which defines when the rule starts to be active. If not set, it’s assumed that rule started to be active. The field follows a date time format with the timezone specified in UTC. Any client implementations setting the startDate field will need to set the time of activation in UTC timezone by converting the local time value to UTC.
payload.endDate
Optional
datetime
Optional field, which defines when the rule starts to be inactive. If not set, it’s assumed that rule will never become inactive. The field follows a date time format with the timezone specified in UTC. Any client implementations setting the startDate field will need to set the time of activation in UTC timezone by converting the local time value to UTC.
payload.severity
Mandatory
integer
A severity of a rule of a bank exclusion/blocking list is returned to a process flow, so further decisions can be made. Possible values are 1 to 10 where 10 is the highest severity.
Possible values are 0 to 10 where 10 is the highest severity.
For cases when there is no matching rule, value is 0.
It is important to mention that one of the fields: country, currency or BIC needs to be set.
