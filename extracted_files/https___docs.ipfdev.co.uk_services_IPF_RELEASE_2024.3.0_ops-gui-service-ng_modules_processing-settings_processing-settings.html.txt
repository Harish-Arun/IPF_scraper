Processing Settings
The Processing Settings module is a CRUD module for reviewing and managing processing settings. This module will let you search and create processing settings via a series of different fields.
Processing Settings Management Test App
The processing settings management test app is an application created to combine the currently available CRUD processing settings for the UI. From this app we can extract a yaml spec with all the API calls available alongside sample requests and responses.
Configuration
Config
This config is used for the dropdowns in the UI. Those being agent identifier types, processing entity account types and subtypes.
This example shows the processing entity account types, to add more you would simply add to this array:
processing-entity-account-types = [
                                   "SuspenseAccount",
                                   "LedgerAccount"
                                  ]
You can change the order in which these types appear in the dropdowns by changing the order in which they appear in the config.
Currently, processing entity account types would appear in the UI in the order in the example above.
If you want the Ledger Account type to appear at the top of the list you would change it to be like this:
processing-entity-account-types = [
                                   "LedgerAccount",
                                   "SuspenseAccount"
                                  ]
