Status Request Scheduler (SRS)
The CSM Service offers a Status Request Scheduler (SRS) capability.
Purpose
Some instant payment schemes offer the capability to send a status request message some time after sending a credit
transfer (when acting as a debtor) or a payment status report (when acting as a creditor).
There are rules relating to when this message can be sent and at what cadence.
The SRS allows the user to automate this capability from within the CSM Service instead of having to schedule these
status requests from within an IPF flow, for example.
The actual format of a Status Request message is determined by the individual CSM Service, e.g. converting the Status
Request to a scheme-specific pacs.028 message.
The current status request scheduling flows that are supported are:
Status Request for ClearAndSettleRequest
Status Request for ReceivePaymentResponse
Mechanism
When the CSM Service receives a the relevant message for forwarding onto the scheme, it will set up
x
scheduled tasks
to send a Status Request message, after
y
duration, separated by
z
durations, where:
x
is the total number of configured Status Request attempts
y
is the initial interval allowed by the payment scheme between the Clear and Settle message and its Status Request
z
represents the list of intervals allowed by the scheme between Status Request messages
For the
ClearAndSettle
flow this would look like the following:
For
ReceivePaymentResponse
:
Once a pacs.002 is received (either as a response to the initial message, or as a response to the status request) then
the SRS cancels all remaining attempts.
Enabling the SRS
The SRS capability is included with all CSM Service implementations and configurable per flow type (see above), but is
disabled by default. It can be enabled by setting a configuration property. See
Appendix A
below.
Appendix A: Per-flow SRS properties
Each SRS type supports the following configuration:
Configuration value
Type
Description
Default value
[prefix].enabled
Boolean
Is the SRS capability active for ClearAndSettle?
false
[prefix].attempts
Integer
The total number of status request attempts the SRS will make for ClearAndSettle
3
[prefix].initial-delay
Duration
Initial delay between sending the Clear And Settle message and sending the first Status Request message for ClearAndSettle
25 seconds
[prefix].intervals-between-status-requests
List of
Duration
List of intervals between Status Request messages for ClearAndSettle.
Ignored if
attempts
is 1
If number of attempts is more than count of intervals, last interval will be used for subsequent attempts
If number of attempts is less than count of intervals, the remaining intervals will be ignored
