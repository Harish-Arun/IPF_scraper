Bulker & Debulker - Changes & Fixes
This page covers the Bulker & Debulker module changes and fixes provided in release IPF-2024.1.0.
Bulker
In the new release, Bulker now passivates bulks after 2 minutes by default. It has been identified that there are some issues when rehydrating actors after passivation has occurred. This will be fixed in the next release. To mitigate this in the current release, it is recommended to increase the bulker passivation timeout to a larger value than what you would expect the bulk to close. For Example, if the largest bulk window is 4 hours, it is recommended to set the value below to at least this value or even higher in your application.conf file:
ipf.bulker.aggregate.actor-idle-timeout = 5h
New
Integration with ODS
Automatic finalisation due to âByte Fullnessâ
Support for client to component id when sending AddComponentCommand, enforcing idempotency in ipf-bulker-aggregate-akka
Enhanced resilience and error reporting
Current bulk size is returned in AddComponent response
The following properties have been added to support command retries:
ipf.bulker.aggregate.retry.processing-timeout
ipf.bulker.aggregate.retry.max-attempts
ipf.bulker.aggregate.retry.backoff-factor
ipf.bulker.aggregate.retry.jitter-factor
Other added config:
ipf.bulker.aggregate.actor-idle-timeout = 2m
(idle duration after which actor will be passivated)
maximum-component-size
(optional, maximum number of components allowed before bulk is auto closed, configured at the bulk level)
Changed
The single bulk behaviour has now been converted to a regular Akka Actor, components saved directly to the ComponentStore as commands are received.
The recurring bulk behaviour has now been converted to a durable state behaviour
Capacity limits applied âper Bulkâ not âper Instanceâ.
File production recovery on system failure
Improved Documentation
Handle recurring bulk commands across multiple nodes
Preventing creation of two single bulk instances by recurring bulk if command to create a new single bulk instance is received while new single bulk instance is being created.
The following properties have been changed
maximum-bulk-size
(optional, maximum allowed size for bulk, configured at the bulk level)
Removed
The following property has been removed
ipf.bulker.auto-close.maximum-components
Debulker
New
Integration with ODS
System events
DuplicateCheckFailed
and
