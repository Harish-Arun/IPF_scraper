UTILS3 - Sanctions Simulator
This document covers how to use the sanctions simulator. There are two recommended approaches for the tutorial, both docker and non-docker. Letâ€™s look at these:
Using the Application Through Docker
Below provides a simple docker file entry for the developer application:
sanctions-sim:
    image: registry.ipf.iconsolutions.com/sample-systems-sanctions-simulator-kafka:2.1.47
    container_name: sanctions-sim
    ports:
      - 5010:5005
      - 8088:55555
    environment:
      - SANCTIONS_MODE=normal
      - SANCTIONS_TRANSPORT=kafka
      - SANCTIONS_SIM_ENCRYPTION_ENABLED=FALSE
    volumes:
      - ./config/sanctions-sim:/sanctions-simulator-kafka/conf
      - ./logs:/ipf/logs
    user: "${UID:-1000}:${GID:-1000}"
    depends_on:
      - kafka
In addition, the application will need configuration which is placed in the
application.conf
file within a config directory relative to the above docker entry. The configuration file contains:
common-kafka-client-settings {
  bootstrap.servers = "kafka:9092"
}

akka.kafka {
  producer {
    kafka-clients = ${common-kafka-client-settings}
  }
  consumer {
    kafka-clients = ${common-kafka-client-settings}
  }
}
When executed the sanctions sim will listen for data on the
SANCTIONS_REQUEST
topic and post back to the
SANCTIONS_RESPONSE
. The logs will be exported to
logs/ipf-developer.app
relative to the docker file.
Using the Application Without Docker
Prerequisites
To run this simulator requires:
A Java 17 runtime
A Kafka environment that either has:
Auto topic creation enabled
Topics created for
SANCTIONS_REQUEST
and
SANCTIONS_RESPONSE
Configuration Options
Property
Description
Default Value
common-kafka-client-settings.bootstrap.servers

localhost:9092
server.port
Defines the port the application will run on
8082
simulator.http.port
Defines the port upon which to listen for http requests.

Download
The sanctions simulator is available here:
nexus.ipf.iconsolutions.com/repository/ipf-releases/com/iconsolutions/ipf/sample/samplesystems/sanctions-simulator-kafka/2.1.47/sanctions-simulator-kafka-2.1.47-runnable.jar
Running
Once downloaded, place it into this directory and run:
java -cp "sanctions-simulator-kafka-2.1.47-runnable.jar:config" -D"loader.main"="com.iconsolutions.samplesystems.sanctions.simulator.SanctionsSimulatorKafkaApplication" "org.springframework.boot.loader.launch.PropertiesLauncher"
The application will then start and be available from:
localhost:55555/index.html
Note that on Windows, the colon in the run command should be replaced by a semicolon.
