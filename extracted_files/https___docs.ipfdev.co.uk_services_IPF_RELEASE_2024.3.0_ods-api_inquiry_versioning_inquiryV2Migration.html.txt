Inquiry API V2 Migration Guide
Specification Changes from V1
The V2 Inquiry API was introduced to remove all
/payment-objects
related endpoints and unify the search parameters for the four
/views/summaries/
endpoints. The following changes have been made:
All endpoints have been updated to have a path beginning with
/api/v2
. For example:
/views/summaries/recalls
→
/api/v2/views/summaries/recalls
/catalogue/process-objects/message-logs
→
/api/v2/catalogue/process-objects/message-logs
etc.
Payment Object endpoints removed:
/all/payment-objects
/all/payment-objects/{odsObjectId}
/all/payment-objects/{paymentObjectId}/history
Every
/catalogue/payment-objects/
endpoint has been removed (e.g.
/catalogue/payment-objects/PAIN_001_CREDIT_TRANSFER_TRANSACTION
)
The search parameters for the four
/views/summaries/
search endpoints have been unified. Previously, these four API endpoints had a mix of similar and unique search fields, now each endpoint can be queried using any of the combined search parameters. This change has been introduced as
custom summary mappings
allow clients to populate any field on a Summary, regardless of journey type. This effects the following endpoints:
/api/v2/views/summaries/payments
/api/v2/views/summaries/recalls
/api/v2/views/summaries/batches
/api/v2/views/summaries/bulks
The response class for all
/views/summaries/
endpoints has changed to
SummaryView
, removing the use of the distinct classes
PaymentSummaryView
,
RecallSummaryView
,
BulkSummaryView
and
BatchSummaryView
. The four deprecated classes all extended SummaryView with no functional changes, the structure and response of the API remain consistent with the V1 implementation. This effects the following endpoints:
/api/v2/views/summaries/payments
/api/v2/views/summaries/payments/{unitOfWorkId}
/api/v2/views/summaries/recalls
/api/v2/views/summaries/recalls/{unitOfWorkId}
/api/v2/views/summaries/batches
/api/v2/views/summaries/batches/{unitOfWorkId}
/api/v2/views/summaries/bulks
/api/v2/views/summaries/bulks/{unitOfWorkId}
Migrating Client Connectors
The
ods-inquiry-client
module has been updated to support both V1 and V2 Inquiry APIs. The default configuration (
ods.inquiry.client.version=2
) enables the instantiation of the V2 Inquiry Client APIs and does not need to be explicitly overridden.
If you are already using the V1 client APIs and do not want to migrate to the V2 client APIs, your configuration must be updated to override the client version configuration as follows:
ods.inquiry.client.version=1
This will ensure the V1 client APIs can be enabled and a code change will not be required. See
V1 Inquiry API client documentation
for more information on the V1 client APIs that can be enabled.
The available V2 Client APIs are listed below. Client API configuration lives under
ods.inquiry.client
, and all properties listed below must be prefixed with this.

Client Connector Changes from V1
The difference from the set of V1 beans is that the
PaymentSummaries
,
BulkSummaries
,
BatchSummaries
, and
RecallSummaries
beans have been replaced with the
Summaries
bean, and the
PaymentObjects
bean has been removed. When migrating to the V2 Client APIs, the following code changes need to be made:
Replace usage of the summary interfaces with
Summaries
. The difference between them is that the
Summaries
search request object requires a instance of the
SummarySearchFields
class, whereas the others, e.g.
PaymentSummaries
requires an instance of the
PaymentSummarySearchFields
class. The new
SummarySearchFields
class contains all the fields available within each of the V1 search fields classes.
All usages of the classes
PaymentSummaryView
,
RecallSummaryView
,
BatchSummaryView
, and
BulkSummaryView
should be replaced with the
SummaryView
class. The four deprecated classes all extended SummaryView with no functional changes, so the migration is a class name change only.
Any use of
PaymentObjects
should be replaced with
MdsObjects
. The
MdsObjects
interface provides the same functionality as
PaymentObjects
, but with field and method name changes from
paymentObject
to
mdsObject
.
Migrating Test Client
The
ods-inquiry-test-client
module has been updated to support both V1 and V2 Inquiry APIs. Similar to the Client APIs, a new set of V2 Test Client APIs are available via the
InquiryClientV2
interface.
Usage
Both the V1 and V2 Test Clients can be used at the same time. If you are migrating from V1 to V2, you will need to update your test suite to use the
InquiryClientV2
interface.
The InquiryClient method
createInquiryClientV2
will return a default instance of the
InquiryClientV2
interface.
@Configuration
class TestClientConfig {
    @Bean
    InquiryClient inquiryClient(@Value("${inquiry.base.url}") final String baseUrl,
                                @Value("${inquiry.openapi-validation.enabled}") final boolean openApiValidation,
                                final CurrentAuthToken currentAuthToken) {
        return InquiryClient.createInquiryClient(InquiryClientOptions.builder()
                .baseUrl(baseUrl)
                .currentAuthToken(currentAuthToken)
                .requestTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(60))
                .openApiValidation(openApiValidation)
                .build());
    }

    @Bean
    InquiryClientV2 inquiryClientV2(@Value("${inquiry.base.url}") final String baseUrl,
                                    @Value("${inquiry.openapi-validation.enabled}") final boolean openApiValidation,
                                    final CurrentAuthToken currentAuthToken) {
        return InquiryClient.createInquiryClientV2(InquiryClientOptions.builder()
                .baseUrl(baseUrl)
                .currentAuthToken(currentAuthToken)
                .requestTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(60))
                .openApiValidation(openApiValidation)
                .build());
    }
}
Test Client Changes from V1
The difference between the V1 and V2 Test Client APIs are as follows:
All APIs have been updated to utilise the V2 Inquiry API specification
The
Payments
,
Batches
,
Bulks
, and
Recalls
interfaces has been deprecated, to be replaced with the
Summaries1
interface.
The
Summaries1
interface uses the
SummarySearchFields
class, whereas
Payments
uses the
PaymentSummarySearchFields
class
The
PaymentObjects
interface has been removed from the
InquiryClient2
interface
The
MdsObjects
interface should be utilised in its place
