Ingress Processing Data
Summary
ipf-processing-data-ingress modules are to be used in applications which need to consume ipf processing data, e.g. ODS.
Transport
The ipf-processing-data
egress
sends IPF Processing Data envelopes over kafka, or http, and there are matching
ingress
components to consume this data.
Kafka
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.iconsolutions.ipf.core.processingdata</groupId>
    <artifactId>ipf-processing-data-ingress-kafka</artifactId>
</dependency>
Config key
Default Value
Description
ipf.processing-data.ingress.transport
kafka
Enable or disable the kafka ingress. Anything other than
kafka
will disable it.
ipf.processing-data.ingress.kafka.consumer.topic
IPF_PROCESSING_DATA
The
topic
from which to consume IPF Processing Data envelopes.
ipf.processing-data.ingress.kafka.consumer.topics
The
topics
from which to consume IPF Processing Data envelopes, e.g.
[ TOPIC_A, TOPIC_B ]
The kafka ingress uses a kafka receive connector, further configuration under the key
ipf.processing-data.ingress.kafka.consumer.*
can be found in the
Connector Configuration
or
Kafka Quickstart
.
Metrics
The following metrics will be reported by the kafka ingress:
ipf_processing_data_ingest_latency
, which records the duration between the time a process object (domain event, system event, message log…​) has been created and the time it has been successfully processed by ODS; the durations will be sensitive to time skew between the servers, so they should be treated as estimates only
ipf_processing_data_ingress_batch_receive_size
, which records the size of each DataEnvelope batch received by your
BatchedIpfProcessingDataHandler
spring bean. See the
guide to consuming processing data
for more information about batch handling.
HTTP
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.iconsolutions.ipf.core.processingdata</groupId>
    <artifactId>ipf-processing-data-ingress-http</artifactId>
</dependency>
Responds to http
POST
requests containing an  IPF Processing Data envelope with http status
ACCEPTED (202)
.
The endpoint is a spring webflux controller and therefore will need to live within a spring webflux application. Configuration specific to spring-framework and spring-web can be found at
spring.io
.
