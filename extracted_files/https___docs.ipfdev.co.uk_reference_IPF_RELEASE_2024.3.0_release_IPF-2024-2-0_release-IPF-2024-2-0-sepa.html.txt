SEPA CT CSM - Changes & Fixes
This page covers the SEPA CT CSM changes and fixes provided in release IPF-2024.2.0.
SEPA CT CSM
Breaking change
- Since the locations for bulker and debulker files and archived files has been changed this may impact any file paths you may have changed from the default.
These will need to be moved to the correct locations in the sepa configurations for ipf.bulker and ipf.debulker. For more information on this change please see
