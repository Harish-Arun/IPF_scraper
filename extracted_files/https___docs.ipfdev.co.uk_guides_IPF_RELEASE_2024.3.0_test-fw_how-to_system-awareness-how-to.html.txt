How do I restrict a message to a given system?
Data to the consumed message with the following entry:
HeaderMetaConstants.RECEIVING_SYSTEM -> "system-1"
All relevant message definitions should be associated with the system via the following builder property.
.withDefaultSystem("system-1")
All relevent MessageTransport instances should be associated with the system via the following builder property
.withSystem("system-1")
All common transports step invocations for the associated message type should have the receivingSystem and sendingSystem property associated
When the 'system-1' sends the 'some message type'
Finally, system awareness is enabled by the setting of the following java system property (default is disabled).
 Note this is global and should be defined in the highest aggregating module containing the runners and stories
system.aware=true
