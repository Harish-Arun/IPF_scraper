Client Processing
Client Processing is a pluggable module which will send a notification to the a downstream implememtation to inform it that components generated by debulker are ready to be processed. It also handles the receiving of notifications to inform the Debulker components have been processed, so that the Debulker can perform housekeeping operations.
Interface
The
ComponentProcessingInitiationPort
interface is defined as follows, and is used to send notifications that components are ready to be processed.
public interface ComponentProcessingInitiationPort {

    CompletionStage<Void> initiateProcessing(InitiateComponentProcessingCommand command);
(1)
}
1
initiateProcessing
is used to send
InitiateComponentProcessingCommand
.
The
ComponentProcessingCompletionPort
interface is defined as follows, and it will handle notifications that processing of components is completed. Application which uses this module will need to implement it.
public interface ComponentProcessingCompletionPort {
    CompletionStage<Void> processingComplete(CompleteComponentProcessingCommand command);
(1)
}
1
processingComplete
is used to handle
CompleteComponentProcessingCommand
.
Implementations
A connector library is used to send and consume messages to/from specific transport.
The current implementations are -
kafka
