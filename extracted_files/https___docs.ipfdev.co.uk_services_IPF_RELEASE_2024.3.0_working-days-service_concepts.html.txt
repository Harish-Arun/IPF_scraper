Concepts
Validation and calculation functionality is accomplished by retrieving an annual calendar and a holiday calendar (both retrieved by a
calendarId
) to determine non-working days. Both calendars are stored as Dynamic Processing Settings (DPS).
An
Annual Calendar
holds configuration of weekends (if applicable) and also defines which days are excluded business days when such days fall on the same date every year (e.g. Christmas Day and Gregorian New Year’s).
A
Holiday Calendar
excludes specific dates where day, month and year are taken into account. This is useful for moving Bank Holidays (e.g. President’s Day) and movable feasts (e.g. Easter, which is based on the lunar calendar).
Calendar Management
Non-working days are defined via either an
Annual Calendar
or
Holiday Calendar
- both calendars are
Dynamic Processing Settings
which can be created/retrieved/updated and deleted via a REST API.

Working Days Setting Management API
