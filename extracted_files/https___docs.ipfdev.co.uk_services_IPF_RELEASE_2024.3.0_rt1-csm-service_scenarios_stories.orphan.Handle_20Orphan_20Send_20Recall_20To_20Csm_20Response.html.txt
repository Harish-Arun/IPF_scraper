Handle Orphan Send Recall To Csm Response.story
Scenario: Handling orphan send recall to csm responses.
When
the ï½Recall Serviceï½  sends a Send Recall To Csm Request
Then
the ï½CSMï½  receives a Payment Cancellation Request
And
ï½Recall Serviceï½  receives a Technical Response with values:
| status | SUCCESS |
When
ï½CSMï½  sends a negative orphan Payment Status Report
Then
ï½Recall Serviceï½  receives a System Event using predicate:
| level                                 | WARN                                                       |
| processingContext.associationId.value | #PaymentStatusReport.fIToFIPmtStsRpt.txInf*And*Sts.orgnlTxId |
| name                                  | OrphanPaymentStatusReportReceived                          |
| type                                  | FUNCTIONAL                                                 |
| payload.csm                           | RT1                                                        |
| payload.status                        | RJCT                                                       |
| payload.rawMessage                    | prettyPrint(#PaymentStatusReport)                          |
| payload.transactionId                 | #PaymentStatusReport.fIToFIPmtStsRpt.txInf*And*Sts.orgnlTxId |
| payload.description                   | OrphanMessageForRecall                                     |
!-- because this will be automatically sent always (i.e. doesn’t matter if we received negative pacs002 or not)
And
ï½Recall Serviceï½  receives a Send Recall To Csm Response using predicate:
|payload.content.txInf*And*Sts[0].orgnlTxId | #SendRecallToCsmRequest.payload.content.undrlyg[0].txInf[0].cxlId |
