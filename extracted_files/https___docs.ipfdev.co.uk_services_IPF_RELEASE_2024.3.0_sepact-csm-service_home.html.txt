SEPA CT CSM Service
The SEPA CT CSM Service is a scheme pack that can be purchased by clients as an add on to the Core IPF toolkit. It will allow the client to construct batch files that are compliant with the EBA SEPA CT service. These batch files will allow credit payments to be passed to and from the Client Bank and the EBA Scheme. As well as batch files of payments, the SEPA CT CSM will handle Result of Settlement Files (RSF) as well as files of all the additional messaging that is available within the scheme (eg Returns, Recalls, Claims and Queries).
