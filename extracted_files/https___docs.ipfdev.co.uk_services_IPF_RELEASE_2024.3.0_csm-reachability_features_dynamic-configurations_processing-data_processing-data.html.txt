Processing Data
Processing Data are the dynamic configurations that are specific to the client implementations. Processing data needs to be defined and configured by the client implementation teams using the DPS setting management APIs provided against each data structure. It should also be possible to configure and maintain some aspects of Processing data using IPF GUI.
Processing data is specific to each Processing Entity in general where multiple processing entities are configured.
Processing data includes below.
Processing Entity
Generic Processing Settings
Agent Settings
Agent Settlement Settings
