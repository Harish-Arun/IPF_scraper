Validating Settlement Date
This function performs the following validation on the date input:
Checks the date is in the future (is after the current date), if the date is in the past then the service returns
valid=false
If the date input is in the future, the service will calculate the execution date by subtracting the
settlementLeadDays
from the settlement date, taking into account non-working days as defined in the
calendarId
input), if the execution date calculated is in the past the service returns
valid=false
If the date input is in the future, the service will calculate the execution date by subtracting the
settlementLeadDays
from the settlement date, taking into account non-working days as defined in the
calendarId
input), if the execution date calculated is
not
in the past the service returns
valid=true
and the input date as settlement date as well as calculated execution date
If the date input is in the future, the service will calculate the execution date by subtracting the
settlementLeadDays
from the settlement date, taking into account non-working days as defined in the
calendarId
input), if the execution date calculated is the same as the current date and the current time is
before
the cutoff then service returns
valid=true
and the input date as settlement date as well as calculated execution date
If the date input is in the future, the service will calculate the execution date by subtracting the
settlementLeadDays
from the settlement date, taking into account non-working days as defined in the
calendarId
input), if the execution date calculated is the same as the current date and the current time is
after
the cutoff then service returns
valid=false
If the date input
is
the current date and the current time is
after
the cutOffTime input, then the service will return
valid=false
If the date input
is
the current date and the current time is
before
the cutOffTime input, then the service will return
valid=true
, the date passed in as well as the calculated settlement date (which is calculated by adding the
settlementLeadDays
to the execution date, taking into account non-working days as defined in the
calendarId
input)
