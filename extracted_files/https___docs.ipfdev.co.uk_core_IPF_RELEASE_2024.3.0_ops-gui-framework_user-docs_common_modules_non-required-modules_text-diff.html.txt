Text Diff Module
The text diff module is responsible for displaying the difference between two JSON objects or two XML objects.
It is also able to display the difference between two different objects such as a JSON and XML object.
It is built using Googleâ€™s
diff-match-patch
library. Currently, this module is used in
ods
in the compare modal
component which displays the difference between two payment objects.
The text diff component has a few different options that can be used to customise the output.
For example, you can view the difference side by side or line by line, show only the lines with differences, and choose whether you want the differences highlighted or not.
This is what the text diff component looks like with the default options.
