FIToFIPaymentStatusReport
TIPS as sender
Recall Assigner as receiver
TIPS unsuccessfully executes one of the checks listed in step 2.
At the first negative check the system stops and sends a message to the Recall Assigner â same DN of the Sender in step 1 â containing the proper error code.

5p
PaymentReturn
Recall Assignee as sender
TIPS as receiver
The Recall Assignee sends a positive response and it is successfully delivered to TIPS.
Technical validation, check of mandatory fields and authentication checks have already been successfully executed.
6p
TIPS
TIPS successfully executes the checks:
- Access Rights check;
- Instructing Party authorised â creditor side;
- Originator Account or CMB existence;
- Beneficiary Account or CMB existence;
- Maximum Amount not exceeded for Returned Amount.
6e
FIToFIPaymentStatusReport
TIPS as sender
Recall Assignee as receiver
TIPS unsuccessfully executes the checks listed in step 6p.
At the first negative check the system stops and sends a message to the Recall Assignee - same DN of the Sender â containing the proper error code.
The status of the positive Recall Response is set to âFailedâ.
In this case the Recall Assignee can submit a new Recall Response in order to close the Recall business case. The message validation will restart from the step 5p.
7p
TIPS
TIPS successfully executes the check:
- Duplicate check for positive Recall .
7e
FIToFIPaymentStatusReport
TIPS as sender
Recall Assignee as receiver
TIPS unsuccessfully executes the check in step 7p.
The system stops and sends a message to the Recall Assignee â same DN of the sender â containing the proper error code.
The status of the positive Recall Response is set to âFailedâ.
In this case the Recall Assignee can submit a new positive Recall Response in order to close the Recall business case. The message validation will restart from the step 5p.
8p
TIPS
TIPS combines the information embedded in the PaymentReturn message to determine a payment transaction dataset to send to the Check and Execute Instruction process.
The status of the positive Recall Response is set to âValidatedâ.
9p
TIPS
The Amount to be settled (AT046 â DS-06) is retrieved and saved as information related to the transaction dataset. From now on, this amount is referred to as "Settlement Amountâ.
The Settlement date for the positive Recall Response (R7 â DS-06) is retrieved and saved as information related to the transaction dataset. From now on, this date is referred to as "Settlement Dateâ.
The Recall Reference of the PSP initiating the Recall (R6 â DS-06) is retrieved and saved as information related to the transaction dataset. From now on, this reference is referred to as âTransaction Identificationâ
10p
TIPS
Given the fact that the original Beneficiary Participant (field AT-23 in DS-02, subset of DS-06) has to be interpreted as the new Originator Participant for the reversed cash flow, TIPS determines the account or CMB to be debited from the configured accounts information, the Beneficiary BIC and the currency within the PaymentReturn message.
In details:
- The system verifies that an account, of either type "TIPS Account" or âTIPS AS Technical Accountâ, exists and is linked to the Beneficiary Participant (field "Beneficiary BIC") as authorised user and has a currency equal to the one defined in the Returned Amount.
- If no Account is linked to the Beneficiary Participant, the system looks for a CMB linked to the Beneficiary (field "Beneficiary BIC") as user;
- The system selects the account linked to the CMB; the account related to the CMB must have a currency equal to the one defined in the Returned Amount.
From now on, the account is referred to as "Originator Account" and the possible CMB as "Debiting CMB".
11p
TIPS
Given the fact that the original Originator Participant (field AT-06 in DS-02, which is part of DS-06) has to be interpreted as the new Beneficiary Participant for the reversed cash, TIPS determines the account or CMB to be credited from the configured accounts information, the Originator BIC and the currency within the PaymentReturn message.
In details:
- The system verifies that an account, of either type "TIPS Account" or âTIPS AS Technical Accountâ, exists and is linked to the Originator Participant (field "Originator BIC") as authorised user and has a currency equal to the one defined in the Returned Amount.
- If no Account is linked to the Originator Participant, the system looks for a CMB linked to the Originator (field "Originator BIC") as user;
- The system selects the account linked to the CMB; the account related to the CMB must have a currency equal to the one defined in the Returned Amount.
From now on, the account is referred to as "Beneficiary Account" and the possible CMB as "Crediting CMB".
12p
TIPS
TIPS successfully executes the checks:
- Originator Account/CMB not blocked;
- Beneficiary Account/CMB not blocked;
- Available amount not exceeded.
12e
FIToFIPaymentStatusReport
TIPS as sender
Recall Assignee as receiver
TIPS unsuccessfully executes the checks listed in step 12p.
At the first negative check the system stops and sends a message to the Recall Assignee (the new Originator DN) containing the proper error code.
The status of the positive Recall Response is set to âFailedâ.
In this case the Recall Assignee can submit a new positive Recall Response in order to close the Recall business case. The message validation will restart from the step 5p.
13p
TIPS
TIPS settles the full amount of the payment transaction, debiting the Originator Account and adding the same positive amount to the Beneficiary Account.
If a Debiting/Crediting CMB is involved, the system decreases/increases its Headroom by the same amount.
TIPS sets the positive Recall Response status to "Settled".
14p
PaymentReturn
TIPS as sender
Recall Assigner as receiver
TIPS forwards the positive response received from the Recall Assignee to the Recall Assigner (the new Beneficiary DN).
15p
FIToFIPaymentStatusReport
TIPS as sender
Recall Assignee as receiver
TIPS generates a positive Payment status report and send it to the Recall Assignee (the new Originator DN).
16p
ReturnAccount
TIPS as sender
Debited Account and/or CMB Owner
TIPS checks the "Floor notification amount" configured for the involved Originator Account or Debiting CMB.
If the account balance or the CMB headroom after settlement is confirmed is lower than the "floor notification amount", TIPS sends a ReturnAccount to the Account and/or CMB owners involved in the transaction.
The message is sent to the default DN of the Account Owner and/or CMB Owner.
The message contains the
- Originator Account Number or the Debiting CMB Number.
17p
ReturnAccount
TIPS as sender
Credited Account and/or CMB Owner
TIPS checks the "Ceiling notification amount" configured for the involved Beneficiary Account or Crediting CMB.
If the account balance or the CMB headroom after the confirmed settlement is greater than the "ceiling notification amount", TIPS sends a ReturnAccount to the Account and/or CMB owners involved in the transaction.
The message is sent to the default DN of the Account Owner and/or CMB Owner.
The message contains the Beneficiary Account Number or the crediting CMB Number.
