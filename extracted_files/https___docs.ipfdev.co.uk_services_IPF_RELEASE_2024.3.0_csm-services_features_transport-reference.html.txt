Transport Reference
This page details all the interfaces going into and out of the CSM service. It has been split into two parts.
Each part describes message queues and topics where the data flows:
Part 1 - from the payment/recall/direct debit service to CSM service
Part 2 - from the CSM service to the payment/recall/direct debit service
Part 1: Payment/Recall Service to CSM service

Note about Kafka configuration keys
Unlike JMS, Kafka configuration is directional, which is why configuration keys have been specified like this:
csm.kafka.
[consumer|producer]
.topics.clear-and-settle.creditor-to-csm
When overriding the topic configuration, be sure to set the right property for the right service depending on the
direction of the message. Use the following table to determine the right prefix to use:
Message kind
Kafka config prefix for Payment/R service
Kafka config prefix for CSM service
Payment Service to CSM service (Part 1)
csm.kafka.
producer
.topics
csm.kafka.
consumer
.topics
CSM service to Payment Service (Part 2)
csm.kafka.
consumer
.topics
csm.kafka.
producer
