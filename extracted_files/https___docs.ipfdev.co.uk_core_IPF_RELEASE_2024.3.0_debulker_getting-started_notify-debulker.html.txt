Sending File Notifications
The Debulker can learn that there is a file ready for processing via a notification, an API is provided which is essentially a receive connector. The Debulker comes with a Kafka implementation of this receive connector.
This means something (script/application/flow) needs to send a Kafka event to a specific topic, thus communicating a new file is ready for processing.
Configuration
The default topic is FILE_NOTIFICATION_REQUEST, but can be overridden, see the
feature page here
.
Notification Format
The notification has several properties which must be provided:
configName
- name of the configuration which will be used by debulker to debulk the bulk file into components.
bulkId
- a globally unique Id to correlate produced components by debulker.
fileProvider
- name of the provider which will be used to retreive the bulk file for processing.
filePath
- path to the file.
FileNotification message example:
{
  "configName": "pain.001.001.09",
  "bulkId": "pain.001.12345",
  "fileProvider": "local",
  "filePath": "/tmp/bulk_files",
  "fileName": "pain_001_test.xml"
}
