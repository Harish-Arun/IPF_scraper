Property Grouping: rt1
Key
Description
Default Value
rt1.send-outcome.enabled
Should RT1 CSM service listen for send-outcome queue? (Default false)
 true - it listens and this will be translated to technical response which will be sent to the clients of RT1 CSM Service
 false - it doesnâ€™t listen for send outcomes. However, RT1 CSM Service will generate appropriate technical response as soon as the message is sent out
false
rt1.receive.am05-ignore.duration
Ignore window. See above.
"PT5S"
rt1.our-bu-id
Our BU id
"cn=icslgbl1,ou=pilot,ou=eba_ips,o=88324,dc=sianet,dc=sia,dc=eu"
rt1.rule.allowed-bics.dbtragt
Used to check if debtor agent is allowed or not.It is also used to create an appropriate pacs002 message. Depending on the configured BICs, the RT1 CSM Service can tell if this pacs002 is inbound or outbound.

rt1.receive.am05-ignore.enabled
If AM05 ignore is enabled, this means that if we get rejection AM05 within configured time ignore window, then the pacs002 reject AM05 message will be logged and ignored. A payment service will never get this message. However, if we get rejection outside of the ignore window, the message will be passed to a payment service for processing where the transaction would usually go in Rejection status. Relevant tickets: PAY-568 and IPA-6346.
false
rt1.local-instrument-cd

"INST"
rt1.slow-receivepayment-request.queue
When the transaction is received it is checked if the time of received message (ReceivePaymentRequest.createdAt) + rt1.receive.timeout.duration is less than now . If it is then the payment has timed out and it will be sent to this slow receive payment queue.
"CsmSlowReceivePaymentRequestQueue"
rt1.rule.allowed-bics.cdtragt
Used to check if creditor agent is allowed or not.

]
Configuration customisation
RT1 service provides some default configuration that can be overridden. One of those is a Clock providing access to the current instant, date and time using a time-zone which is used to verify dates on schemas.
The default provided implementation uses system UTC:
@Bean
    @ConditionalOnMissingBean
    Clock rt1Clock() {
        return Clock.systemUTC();
    }
This bean can be overridden by client implementation to use different time zone.
