Character Replacement
The character replacement module is a mechanism to use configurable character set rules to sanitize messages going via a scheme pack.
Example usage
The module uses spring configuration to define the rules used.  The interface CharacterReplacer has a default implementation provided by spring, so to use simply add the csm-character-replacement module to maven and then dependency injection will pull the implementation through.
Then we simply pass the message (in string format) to our characterReplacer, this will return a sanitized string.
System.out.println(characterReplacer.replaceCharacters("ÃÃÃ"))

# prints AAA
If you wish to only replace part of the message, you can include optional startFrom and endAfter strings, which will find the first instance of those strings; within the message; and will only replace characters within those boundaries, including the startFrom and endAfter strings.
System.out.println(characterReplacer.replaceCharacters("ÃÃÃ Ã­Ã®Ã¯ Ã©Ã¨Ãª", Optional.of(Ã­Ã®Ã¯), Optional.empty())

# prints ÃÃÃ iii eee
(everything after and including Ã­Ã®Ã¯ is replaced)

System.out.println(characterReplacer.replaceCharacters("ÃÃÃ Ã­Ã®Ã¯ Ã©Ã¨Ãª", Optional.empty(), Optional.of(Ã­Ã®Ã¯))

# prints AAA iii Ã©Ã¨Ãª
(everything before and including Ã­Ã®Ã¯ is replaced)

System.out.println(characterReplacer.replaceCharacters("ÃÃÃ Ã­Ã®Ã¯ Ã©Ã¨Ãª", Optional.of(Ã­Ã®Ã¯), Optional.of(Ã­Ã®Ã¯))

# prints ÃÃÃ iii Ã©Ã¨Ãª
(only Ã­Ã®Ã¯ is replaced)
Configuration
There are 3 types of configuration available;
Char-to-char - replace a single character with another
list-to-char - replace any character in a list to a defined character
regex-to-char - replace any character in a regular expression to a defined character
Any combination of these 3 is possible if required.
