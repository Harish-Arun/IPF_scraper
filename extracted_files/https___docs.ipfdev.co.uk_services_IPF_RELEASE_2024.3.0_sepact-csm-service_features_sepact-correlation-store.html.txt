Correlation Store
When a Bulk file containing <N> payments (e.g. an ICF containing <N> pacs.008s) has been sent out by the sepact-csm-service, after a period of time, it will then receive a response for a subset of these payments in another Bulk file (e.g. pacs.002s in a CVF). The sepact-csm-service needs to be able to find and link the payments in this received response to the original outbound payments.
The sepact-correlation-store module provides a correlation store that is used to persist the Transaction ID of the CdtTrfTxInf passed to the bulker and the unique Bulk ID of the pacs.008 Bulk it is stored in. This ensures that when a pacs.002 is received from SEPA CT it is possible to identify all the message IDs that were in it.
The correlation store is used in this way during the processing of all message types, to link scheme responses to their original request.
Time To Live
The store is implemented via MongoDB. By default it will persist correlation entries for 30 days based on the
createdAt
field. It does this by creating a TTL on the MongoDB collection. Once the time has expired entries will be evicted from the collection and no longer available.
If you want to override the default value, you can include your value in the ipf.conf file:
ipf.csm.sepa-common.correlation-store.ttl-duration = P30D
The format of the provided String value should be a Java Duration as an ISO-8601 representation, for example P30D (30 days).
