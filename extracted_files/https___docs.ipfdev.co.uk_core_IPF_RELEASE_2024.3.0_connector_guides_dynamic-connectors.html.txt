Registering Dynamic Connectors
How do I register a dynamically generated Connector as a Bean
It is important that all Connectors are registered as Beans into the spring context. IPF leverages this fact in the Connector health indicators (ConnectorHealthIndicator) and internal event processors (ConnectorEventProcessor).
Traditionally a connector would be created as a standard bean as follows:
@Bean
    public ReceiveConnector<CustomerCreditTransferInitiation> executePaymentReceiveConnector(
            ReceiveConnectorTransport initPaymentReceiveConnectorTransport,
            RequestHandler someRequestHandler,
            ActorSystem actorSystem) {
        return ReceiveConnector.<CustomerCreditTransferInitiation>builder("InitPaymentReceive", "initpayment.receive-connector", actorSystem)
                .withMessageLogger(m -> log.debug("Receive connector has identified message: {}", m.getMessage()))
                .withProcessingContextExtractor(tm -> ProcessingContext.builder()
                        .unitOfWorkId(UnitOfWorkId.createRandom())
                        .build())
                .withConnectorTransport(initPaymentReceiveConnectorTransport)
                .withReceiveTransportMessageConverter(message -> this.convertResponse(message.getPayload().toString()))
                .withReceiveHandler((context, payload) -> someRequestHandler.process(payload))
                .build();
    }
Sometimes it is not possible to define a Bean at compile time, and you may need to dynamically create the connector at runtime.
To do this you need to register the connector object into the ApplicationContext at startup as follows (here we use @PostConstruct):
@Autowired
private final ConfigurableApplicationContext context;

@PostContruct
public void createDynamicConnector() {
   ReceiveConnector<InitiationRequest> connector = createDynamicReceiveConnector();
   context.getBeanFactory().registerSingleton(connector.getName(), connector);
}
To verify the connector has been added to the ApplicationContext bean factory you can visit the
actuator/health
endpoint and your connector should appear in the list.
