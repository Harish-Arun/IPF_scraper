Bulk Producer
The Bulk Producer is responsible for subscribing to the stream of bulk components provided by the
Joiner
and writing each one to the
Bulk Output Stream Provider
resulting in the production of a bulk file.
The bulk file will be output to a location as specified in the bulk configurations, where each configuration entry could have its own output location. The configuration property is:
ipf.bulker.configuration[0].file-path
Example:
ipf.bulker {
  configurations = [
    {
      name = "pain.001.001.09"
      file-name-prefix = "bulk-"
      file-path = "/tmp/bulks"
      component-hierarchy {
        component-parser-name = "xml"
        marker = "Document"
        children = [
          {
            marker = "CstmrCdtTrfInitn.PmtInf"
            children = [
              {
                before-elements = ["SplmtryData"]
                marker = "CdtTrfTxInf"
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
      auto-close-triggers = ["customAutoCloseTrigger"]
      maximum-component-size = 50
      scheduled-auto-close = {
        auto-close-by-age = 30s
        schedule-at = "*/10 * * ? * *"
      }
      finalise-on-auto-close = true
    }
]
}
Retries
If there is a system crash whilst a bulk file is being produced then on restart the file production process will be retried.
If at any point during the bulk file production process an exception is encountered a system event will be raised allowing
for a manual intervention process to take place. In this scenario the problem bulk file detailed in the event should be removed
manually before attempting to finalising the bulk again.
