Data Processing & Persistence
Being able to manage data is crucial to the success of any IPF project.  IPF provides it’s own canonical data model based on the ISO standards, but it’s able to support any other types required too.
The key moving pieces are:
Processing Data - this consists of several modules responsible for producing and consuming data generated by IPF applications via different transports.
System Events - this module can be used to notify consumers of various events that take place in the IPF ecosystem (or any system related to IPF). These can be converted to meaningful statistics or reformatted and relayed to other downstream systems for consumption and subsequent action.
Operational Data Store (ODS) - This is an Additional Optional Module (AOM) which gives insight in the end-to-end lifecycle of a payment. This is achieved by providing access to the payment data and related processing data to perform activities like tracking & tracing of payments, exception handling and monitoring.
Akka Persistence - this consists of storing Event Sourced Behaviours onto disk to support recovery and replaying of events.
