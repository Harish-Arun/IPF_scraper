Common Components Module
A module for components and directives that can be used across any IPF angular application.
These components were originally in the parent components folder but since moving to a more modular structure have not had a module home.
The long term development plan should be to find these components/directives modules that suit their functionality better.
Components
DateFilterComponent
A component to allow the user to filter a column by date. agGrid is required to use this component.
DateTimeAgoComponent
A component that allows the user to switch between date formats.
DynamicListComponent (Legacy)
A component to allow the user to add and remove items from a list.
TooltipComponent
A tooltip component.
BreadcrumbsComponent
A component to display a list of navigation items
Example usage:
<ipf-breadcrumbs [navLinks]="navLinks"></ipf-breadcrumbs>
Where navLinks is an array of BreadcrumbNavLink objects:
Name
Description
link?: string[];
A value used for the routerLink e.g. ['../../', 'testing', 'view']
title: string;
A value used for the text value displayed
Directives
ShowWarningDirective
A directive to decide whether to show a warning icon or not.
Example:
<div ipfShowWarning="showWarning"
>This text will appear with a warning symbol next to it if showWarning=true</div>
Pipes
DateTimezonePipe
A pipe that will add the UTC offset to the date based on the users location obtained from the browser
e.g. A user based in Berlin will have a date appear with (UTC+1) during CET
