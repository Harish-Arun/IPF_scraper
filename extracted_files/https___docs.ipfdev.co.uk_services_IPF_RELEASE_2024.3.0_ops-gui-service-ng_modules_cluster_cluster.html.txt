Cluster Management
The Ops Service will provide cluster health information and Icon libraries versions used by the nodes of the upstreams
services. There is no auto-discovery, we rely on the akka management API to retrieve information about nodes that are
not part of the configuration.
Configuration
Systems to monitor
The configuration for the cluster management modules includes a list of systems to monitor:
ipf.business-operations.cluster-management.systems = [
    {
        name = "ODS Inquiry"
        base-urls = [
            "http://ods-inquiry-app:8080"
        ],
        akka-management = false,
        actuator = {
            protocol = "http",
            port = "8080"
        }
    },
]
Name
Description
name
Human readable identifier for the system
base-urls
List of one or more cluster node urls where the Akka Management API is available
akka-management
Whether the cluster is managed by Akka and Akka management is enabled. If
false
, itâ€™s assumed that only the provided
 URLs are part of the cluster, if
true
, the application will try to discover all the members using Akka.
actuator.protocol
Protocol to be used when using the spring boot actuator endpoints
actuator.port
Port number where spring actuator is listening, the host will be assumed to be the same as the one provided in the base
 URL.
Caching
When fetching the cluster members and version information, the data returned is cached for a configurable period of time. See below for the default configuration (and see the IPF Cache docs for more details):
#tag::caching[]
ipf.caching.caffeine {
  enabled = true
  settings {
    # Cache that holds the Akka cluster member returned by Akka Management
    akka-cluster-members {
      timeout = 5m
      max-size = 20
    }

    # Cache that holds the health information for each node
    # belonging to a monitored system's cluster
    cluster-member-health {
      timeout = 5m
      max-size = 100
    }

    # Cache that holds the version information for each node
    # belonging to a monitored system's cluster
    cluster-member-versions {
      timeout = 10m
      max-size = 100
    }
  }
}
Retries
When calling into the monitored systems, the data returned is cached for a configurable period of time. See below for the default configuration (and see the IPF Cache docs for more details):
ipf.business-operations.cluster-management = {

  # How long to wait for the response to return
  call-timeout = 2s

  # How many times to attempt a call to an endpoint
  max-attempts = 1

  # How many times to call out to an endpoint before opening the circuit breakers
  minimum-number-of-calls = 100

  # The initial backoff when doing retries
  initial-retry-wait-duration = 1s

  # Which HTTP statuse codes to not retry on
  non-retryable-status-codes = [400, 404, 403]
}
