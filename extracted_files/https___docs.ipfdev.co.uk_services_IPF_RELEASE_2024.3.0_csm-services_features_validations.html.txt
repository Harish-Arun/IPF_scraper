Validations
The CSM Service has this concept of
CSM Validator
or
CSM DD Validator
which is specified per CSM. It allows to perform a series of validations which fall into three categories:
Inbound: For received messages
Outbound: For sent messages
Bidirectional: For validations that are applicable in both directions
The following standard validations are available from the CSM Service Starter and can be reused when creating a CSM integration.
If the condition in Check Performed is not met, Validation returns a
Validation Failure
or a custom generic type in the case of Direct Debit, which requires more flexibility.
For details on how to access these validations from outside the CSM Service please refer to
Transport Reference
.
When instantiating the
CSM Validator
, the following validations are available:
Validation
Check Performed
Reason Code
Acceptance Date Validator
When the
timeoutEnabled
property is set, checks the Acceptance Date Time in the document (retrieved by a function specified per CSM) is after the current time plus the
timeout
duration specified
Configurable.
Default: AB06
Bic Validator
Checks if the BIC (retrieved from the request via a function specified per CSM) is not contained in the list of allowed bics. This checked list is configured via HOCON config and is either a list of allowed of creditor agent BICs or debtor agent BICs

Checks if any of the following mutually exclusive fields have both been populated:
GrpHdrIBAN / GrpHdrOthrId
GrpHdrCd / GrpHdrPrtry
CdTrfInfCd / CdTrxInfPrtry
CdtTrfTxInfRemittanceInfoStandard / CdtTrfTxInfRemittanceInfoNotStandard
