ODS & GUI - Changes & Fixes
This page covers the Operation Data Store (ODS) and GUI changes and fixes provided in release IPF-2024.2.0.
ODS
New
V2 ODS Inquiry API specification.
New Inquiry API version introduced to remove all
/payment-objects
endpoints (replaced with
/mds-objects
) and to unify search parameters and response types of the
/views/summaries/
endpoints.
The ODS Inquiry application can handle calls to both the V2 and V1 Inquiry APIs
A new set of client connectors can be enabled for the V2 API.
It is important to note that a config change
MUST
be applied if you are already using the V1 client connectors and do not want to immediately migrate to the V2 client connectors. Your configuration must be updated to override the client connector version configuration as follows:
ods.inquiry.client.version=1
This will ensure your current V1 client connectors remain enabled and a code change will not be required. See
V1 Inquiry API client documentation
for more information on the V1 client APIs that can be enabled.
Versioning details and the full V2 migration guide can be found on the
API versioning overview
page
Changed
Fixed an issue where ODS attempted to amend documents in the
unitOfWorks
collection concurrently, sometimes resulting as two inserts, and therefore a duplicate key exception. This impacted archiving which relied on attributes of the unit of work that had failed to be written.
The following changes apply to ODS Inquiry API Version 2 only
Improved support for customised summary mappings in ODS where the customised fields are not typically used for the journey type being customised.
Simplified summary responses - all possible summary fields are returned for all journey types.
Simplified summary search parameters - all possible summary search fields are supported for all journey types.
GUI
