Scaffolder Concepts
Output
Once the scaffolder has run it will generate a new project.
This key configuration options to consider here is the 'outputDir' and 'artifactId'
This properties will be used to determine the location to which th name of the generated project.
So if running with an 'artifactId' for example of 'my-test' and an outputDir of '/build' then this will lead to a new folder being generated called /build/my-test.
Inside this folder will be a fully functional IPF application which can be used as the basis from which to build your IPF application"
The Icon BOM
The generated project uses the Icon BOM (a Maven Bill of Materials) as its parent.
This provides all the dependencies and their versions for the generated application to use.
If the project you are building needs to extend for your own parent, this can be updated post generation.
