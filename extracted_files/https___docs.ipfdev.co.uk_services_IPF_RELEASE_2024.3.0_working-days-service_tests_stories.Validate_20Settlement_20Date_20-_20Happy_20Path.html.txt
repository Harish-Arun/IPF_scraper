Validate Settlement Date - Happy Path.story
Scenario: Validate Settlement Date Happy Path
Steps
Given the working days service is available
When the 'setting manager' sends a 'Create Annual Calendar Setting' request with values:
| requiresApproval         | false            |
| payload.calendarId       | uid('SEPAStep2') |
| payload.weekendDayOne    | SATURDAY         |
| payload.weekendDayTwo    | SUNDAY           |
| payload.excludedDates[0] | 05-01            |
| payload.excludedDates[1] | 12-25            |
| payload.excludedDates[2] | 12-26            |
| payload.excludedDates[3] | 01-01            |
And the 'Get Annual Calendar Setting' request is sent, updated values are eventually reflected in the 'Setting Response' received by 'setting manager':
| payload.calendarId | uid('SEPAStep2') |
When the 'setting manager' sends a 'Create Holiday Calendar Setting' request with values:
| requiresApproval     | false            |
| payload.calendarId   | uid('SEPAStep2') |
| payload.excludedDate | 2123-04-09       |
And the 'Get Holiday Calendar Setting' request is sent, updated values are eventually reflected in the 'Setting Response' received by 'setting manager':
| payload.calendarId | uid('SEPAStep2') |
When the 'setting manager' sends a 'Create Holiday Calendar Setting' request with values:
| requiresApproval     | false            |
| payload.calendarId   | uid('SEPAStep2') |
| payload.excludedDate | 2123-04-11       |
And the 'Get Holiday Calendar Setting' request is sent, updated values are eventually reflected in the 'Setting Response' received by 'setting manager':
| payload.calendarId | uid('SEPAStep2') |
When the 'setting manager' sends a 'Create Holiday Calendar Setting' request with values:
| requiresApproval     | false            |
| payload.calendarId   | uid('SEPAStep2') |
| payload.excludedDate | 2124-03-30       |
And the 'Get Holiday Calendar Setting' request is sent, updated values are eventually reflected in the 'Setting Response' received by 'setting manager':
| payload.calendarId | uid('SEPAStep2') |
When the 'setting manager' sends a 'Create Holiday Calendar Setting' request with values:
| requiresApproval     | false            |
| payload.calendarId   | uid('SEPAStep2') |
| payload.excludedDate | 2124-04-02       |
And the 'Get Holiday Calendar Setting' request is sent, updated values are eventually reflected in the 'Setting Response' received by 'setting manager':
| payload.calendarId | uid('SEPAStep2') |
When the 'payment engine' sends a 'Validate Settlement Date' request with values:
| META.dateInput          | <DateInput>          |
| META.calendarId         | uid('SEPAStep2')     |
| META.settlementLeadDays | <SettlementLeadDays> |
| META.cutOffTime         | <CutOffTime>         |
Then the 'payment engine' receives a 'Date Function Response' with values:
| executionDate  | <ExpectedExecutionDate>  |
| settlementDate | <ExpectedSettlementDate> |
| valid          | true                     |
Examples:

offsetTimeMinutesFromNow(10)
2124-03-31
3
2124-03-27
2124-03-31
offsetTimeMinutesFromNow(-10)
Example: {DateInput=2123-06-09, SettlementLeadDays=2, ExpectedSettlementDate=2123-06-09, ExpectedExecutionDate=2123-06-07, CutOffTime=offsetTimeMinutesFromNow(-10)}
