Using the persistent scheduler to support flows
The
ipf-flo-scheduler
module provides an out of the box mechanism to support the usage of the
ipf-flo-scheduler
with a flo without having to add any additional configuration.
To use, it is simply necessary to add the dependency to the module:
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.iconsolutions.ipf.core.platform</groupId>
    <artifactId>ipf-flo-scheduler</artifactId>
</dependency>
This will inject all the necessary components via spring into your project.  All that is then required is the standard configuration for determining which actions and states require scheduling information.
