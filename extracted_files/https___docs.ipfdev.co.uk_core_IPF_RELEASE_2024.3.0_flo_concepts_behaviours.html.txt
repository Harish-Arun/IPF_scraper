Behaviours
In IPF we define
behaviours
for the processing of inputs to the system (from a response or instruction) and to specify the actions required when processing events. For this we have two concepts:
"
Input Behaviour
" - this is a behaviour that specifies for each input what event will be generated.
"
Event Behaviour
"  - this is the behaviour that specifies what actions should be taken on receipt of an event.
Input Behaviour
An input behaviour has a number of properties:
"
Input
" - the input (instruction or response) upon which the behaviour is triggered.
"
Response code
" - the response code (linked to the response if the response is an input, otherwise this field is not applicable) for which the behaviour applies
"
Event
" - this can be either an event directly or via the execution and resulting outcome of a decision.
Note that when using response codes, if one is not defined on an input behaviour this will be considered the "default" behaviour for all response codes.
Event Behaviour
The event behaviour is a little more complicated.  It has a number of properties:
"
Current State
" - this is the state upon which the flow must be in for the behaviour to apply.
"
Criteria
" - this is when the behaviour applies ( on / on all of / on any of)
"
Events
" - one or more events, these can be any type of event (e.g. domain, timeout etc)
"
Move to State
" - the destination state of the behaviour
"
Actions
" - these are the list of actions (1 or more) that should be performed after the state transition, i.e. requests, notifications etc.
This behaviour definition then says - whilst in
Current State
, when the
Criteria
is met with these
Events
, then "
Move to State
" and perform the list of
Actions
.
Adding the behaviours we get:
Note that the aggregate function (discussed
here
), as a self contained unit of calculation is not considered as either event or input behaviour but as a functional capability of itâ€™s own.
Initiation Behaviour
There is one more key type of behaviour to consider within an IPF Flow, that is the "
Initiation Behaviour
".
The initiation behaviour is a specialised version of the previously defined input behaviour but is only used to start a flow.  It is not linked to an external domain so that we can initiate the flow potentially from many different sources.
An initiation behaviour has a number of properties:
"
On Received Data
" - A list of business data taken on input to the flow
"
Move to State
" - An initial state to move to
"
Perform
" Action - A list of actions to perform
& optionally
"
Perform Enrichment
" - Call a function for
Input Enrichment
of the event
"
Generate Aggregate Data
" - Call an
Aggregate Function
for operating on the Aggregate
Note that when the initiation behaviour is invoked, a flow will start and the "FlowInitiated" event will be raised.
