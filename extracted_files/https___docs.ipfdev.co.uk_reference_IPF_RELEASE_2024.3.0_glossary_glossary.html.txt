Sanction checking is a capability to check entities/customers which are sanctions listed, PEP’s marked   etc by various regulators, FATF , OFAC, EU etc and if caught during sanction checking process needs to be stopped further processing until approved by compliance teams.
There are two results during a Sanctions check which are "HIT" or "No HIT". "HIT" could be:
1. "HIT-REFER" are stopped from further processing and logged to Case management tool which is looked upon by a Case investigation (usually Legal and Compliance Teams).
2. "FALSE HIT" hits are processed to the next steps of payments processing.
"No HIT" means it’s a safe transaction and should be executed in next steps of payments processing.
Sanctions check can be used to stop payments by a combination of criteria (some of which are optional):
1. Account Identity
2. Originator identity
3. Instruction reference
4. Agreement or mandate reference
5. Min or Max amount
Every Sanction list, data etc are stored in the centralized data hubs for ease of use and they are invoked by appropriate Control Services.

Schedule
Scheduler ensures that the execution of payments is started at a time that allows any needed value added services(Future dated payments, Batch payments etc) to be applied and their value date time to be met. The scheduler monitors the payment data store for individual and bulk payments whose value date & time and associated value added services(Netting, Bulking, Enrichment, Remittance handling etc.) makes them eligible for execution.
The scheduler also monitors the payment data store for any re-occurring payment schedules that require a payment to be created and executed in order for value added services to be applied and the value date & time schedule to be met.
Whenever a payment is found or created that is eligible for execution the scheduler invokes any needed value added services and triggers the execution of the payment.
Scheduler is usually used for make payments i.e.:
1. Future Dated Payments
2. SEPA CT Payments
3. SEPA DD etc

A stereotype may have associated tags, that allow parameterised values to be set whenever it is used.
UML stereotypes
STET
STET’s Instant Payments CSM (IP CSM) is a  clearing and settlement mechanisms for SCT Inst transactions.

Story
In agile software development, a story is a particular business need assigned to the software development team. Stories must be broken down into small enough components that they may be delivered in a single development iteration.
Support
'Support' provides use cases for some of the below :
1. BAM(Business Activities Monitoring) :
2. Monitor Production Systems behaviour.
3. Collect System information
4. Send information to appropriate teams/services during system fails, wrong transactions etc so that system/services can be fixed for smooth processing of payments messages.
N.B: BAM team does not solve any problem
Swagger
API toolkit - Used to develop IPFâs APIs.

Tag
An attribute associated with a UML stereotype that enables values to be assigned to pre-defined parameters when the stereotype is used.
TCH
The Clearing House. Long-established US payments clearing and settlements provider, currently developing a central infrastructure to deliver Real-Time Payments to the US market.

Technical Duplicate Check
Technical duplicate check for an inbound or outbound payments message using hash techniques or any other solution to ensure that a file is not   duplicate.
Technical duplicate check is intended to detect files/messages that are totally identical which are usually caused by malfunction application or middle ware. This service is often provided by the channel.
Technical duplicate check is different from business duplicate check. If a payment is found to be a duplicate (with same payment reference, amount, sender and beneficiary etc) then the payment is rejected   back to the originator.
Terms and Conditions
Determination of terms and conditions of the involved parties. This step determines the charges, tariffs etc for the customers by reading the customer profiles. Profiles may contain the combination of the below data:
1. Customer conditions
2. Fees
3. Products
4. Covenant management( contract, signatures etc)
Timeout Watchman
IPF component that monitors timeouts on endpoint systems.
TARGET Instant Payment Settlement service (TIPS)
TARGET Instant Payment Settlement service.

Transaction
Data about events that have happened, e.g. payments.
Transition
A UML notation element used in constructing State Machine Diagrams. A transition represents the change from one state to another. A State Machine Diagram can include multiple transitions.
Transmission
Transmission is invoked when the payments file is ready to be transmitted to relevant scheme i.e. EBA, Target 2, STET etc.
Depending on the payment type the file is batched or sent as single file to the scheme. i.e. SCT Inst goes as a single file and SCT goes as a bulk file.

Unavailable
One of the possible states that IPF assigns to an endpoint.

Value Added Service
A service providing extra functionality above and beyond payments functionality. These services can be charged for to provide revenue streams for the bank. See Value Added Services(VAS)
Velocity
Velocity is a metric for work done, which is often used in agile software development. Measuring velocity is sometimes called velocity tracking. The velocity metric is used for planning sprints and measuring team performance.
Vostro & Nostro Accounts
The words come from from Italian, nostro and vostro; in English, 'ours' and 'yoursâ.
A  nostro  is our account of our money, held by the other bank
A  vostro  is our account of other bank money, held by us
WoW (Ways of Working)
Ways of working is how a team collaborates. The WoW will be documented and agreed and adhered to throughout the duration of a project.
.xmi
XML Metadata Interchange. The file format used to export diagrams from Modelio and import into IPF.
YAML
API mark-up language - Mark-up language used to describe APIs. YAML enables you to describe an API and generate client code, server code and documentation (HTML). YAML is used with Swagger to define IPFâs APIs.
