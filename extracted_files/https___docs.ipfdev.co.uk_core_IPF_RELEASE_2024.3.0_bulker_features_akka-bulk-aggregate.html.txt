Akka Bulk Aggregate
Akka Bulk Aggregate is a
BulkAggregate
implementation which uses akka actors for ingesting bulk components and performing validation.
Maven Dependency
To use the Akka Bulk Aggregate, the following dependency must be provided, with a version matching
ipf-bulker
to ensure compatibility.
<dependency>
        <groupId>com.iconsolutions.ipf.bulk</groupId>
        <artifactId>ipf-bulker-aggregate-akka</artifactId>
        <version>${ipf-bulker.version}</version>
    </dependency>
Retry Configuration
Akka Bulk Aggregate uses AskWithRetry pattern when sending commands to Single and Recurring Bulk actors, with the following configuration.
ipf.bulker.aggregate.retry {
    # The amount of time to wait for the Aggregate to process a single BulkCommand message
    processing-timeout = 5s

    # The number of times to attempt sending a single command to the aggregate
    max-attempts = 3

    # The delay multiplier to use on subsequent send attempts
    backoff-factor = 2

    # The percentage of randomness to use when retrying bulk commands
    jitter-factor = 0.2
}
Bulk Actor Passivation
In case there is no interaction with recurring/single bulk actor, that actor will be passivated after configured time. Default value is set to '2m' (2 minutes), but it can be overriden using this property:
ipf.bulker.aggregate.actor-idle-timeout
.
