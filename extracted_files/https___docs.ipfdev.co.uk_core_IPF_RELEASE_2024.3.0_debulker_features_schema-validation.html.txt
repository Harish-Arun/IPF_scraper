Schema Validation
This provides an optional setting to validate an incoming XML file against a Schema object generated from the relevant XSD files. In the event that schema validation fails, the file will not be debulked.
Validation prior to debulking is only possible for XML files.
Validation can be enabled for each
Debulking Configuration
by providing
validate-before-debulk.schema-bean-name
config path within the configuration. The value provided should match the Spring bean name that provides the relevant
javax.xml.validation.Schema
object to validate against. In the event that no bean name is provided, or the relevant bean is not configured/available, the debulker will fail to start.
