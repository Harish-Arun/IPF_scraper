Deployment & Configuration
The options for integrating with working days service from a client application are outlined below.
Standalone
The working days service is deployed as a separate application and accessed via a REST interface. Client connectors are available to assist with invoking the working days service from a client application.
Add the following dependency to a client application to utilise the client connectors to access the working days service if it is deployed as a standalone application:
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.iconsolutions.ipf.csm.workingdays</groupId>
    <artifactId>working-days-service-client-connector</artifactId>
</dependency>
Configuration
Property Name
Type
Comment
Default
ipf.working-days-service.connector.enabled
boolean
Enable connectors for integrating with WDS
true
ipf.working-days-service.connector.http.client.host
String
Hostname where working days service is deployed
localhost
ipf.working-days-service.connector.http.client.port
String
HTTP port where WDS can be accessed
8080
ipf.working-days-service.connector.http.client.endpoint-url
String
Path to access the service
/
As with all connectors, resiliency-settings can also be configured at the config path
ipf.working-days-service.connector.resiliency-settings
. Specific properties that can be configured are documented
Resilience
Embedded
Alternatively, the working days service can be embedded into an existing application.
Add the following dependency to an existing application to add working days service functionality to that application.
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.iconsolutions.ipf.csm.workingdays</groupId>
    <artifactId>working-days-service-starter-direct</artifactId>
</dependency>
Which can then be accessed using the client dependency below, this dependency provides convenience methods that allow for passing
ProcessingContext
with request and response message.
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.iconsolutions.ipf.csm.workingdays</groupId>
    <artifactId>working-days-service-client-direct</artifactId>
</dependency>

Default
ipf.working-days-service.direct.enabled
boolean
Enable client access to WDS directly, used when WDS is embedded inside the client application
true
With this option Working Days Service Functionality is added to an existing application and is accessible via the
WorkingDaysServiceClientPort
Embedded Working Days Service, DPS Setting Management Standalone*
*Not yet supported
Another option is to have the working days service embedded into an existing application, but to deploy DPS as a separate application.
Add the following dependency to an existing application to add working days service functionality but call out to a DPS instance that is deployed as a separate application.
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.iconsolutions.ipf.csm.workingdays</groupId>
    <artifactId>working-days-service-starter-connector</artifactId>
</dependency>
