Getting Started
CSM Reachability Service and Data Configuration
To start using CSM-Reachability we need to define few steps.
Choose deployment pattern
First, you need to define which deployment pattern you want to use, for more info about it, please visit
Deployments
We recommend taking the approach with CSM application stand alone and DPS embedded with CSM. This means you will have to deploy a springboot application (which you have to define and create), which uses the modules listed.
Configure settings
After that, you should go to Configuration part and see what is difference between static and dynamic configuration and what you need to define for both of them. Also, you can see what is necessary to put in
pom.xml
and
.conf
files and which parts are mandatory.
Static Configuration
Dynamic Configuration
In the Dynamic Configuration section you can see examples of how to create settings, please refer to
getting-started/dynamic-configuration-set-up/dynamic-configurations-set-up-guide.adoc#_2_set_up_using_dps_setting_management_apis
.
Also, this is an example of
ConfigMap Manifest
file in which you can see whole
.config
example

Client implementation to call CSM Reachability APIs
Define ports, adapters and connectors
The work required to call the CSM APIs from your IPF application/flow is covered on this page:
Client Library
This covers the Maven dependencies which should be added to your project and you can see an example of defining the Client Port, Client Adapter (as the implementation of Port interface) and examples of defining connectors.
For all those connectors you should use
Static Configuration
, this covers all default settings for each connector but each of them can be overridden as per your requirements.
API Specifications
There are 2 types of API specifications:
CSM Reachability Setting Management API
for
DPS Settings
and
CSM Reachability Service API
for
CSM Reachability
part.
For the list of available APIS please refer to
CSM Reachability Setting Management API
CSM Reachability Service API
