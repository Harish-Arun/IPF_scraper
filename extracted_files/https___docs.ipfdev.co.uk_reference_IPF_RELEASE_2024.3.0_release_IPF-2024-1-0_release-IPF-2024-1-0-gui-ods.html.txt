ODS & GUI - Changes & Fixes
This page covers the Operation Data Store (ODS) changes and fixes provided in release IPF-2024.1.0.
ODS
New
IPF Metrics Processor
The IPF Metrics Processor is an optional add-on. It utilises kafka to produce payment metrics, which includes counts and durations of finished payments, and counts of error codes.
Additonal documentation and implementation guidelines found here. (Currently only staging docs, Will update link to external docs upon doc release)
Camt027 and Camt087 MDS Object Support
Camt.027 and camt.087 MDS Data can now be sent via the IPF Processing Data Kafka topic and ingested by ODS.
There are two new ODS Inquiry API endpoints to query for these additional MDS objects:
/catalogue/mds-objects/CAMT_027
/catalogue/mds-objects/CAMT_087
Both MDS objects can also be returned as part of the following ODS Inquiry API endpoints responses:
/all/mds-objects/{odsObjectId}
/all/mds-objects/{mdsObjectId}/history
/views/details/{unitOfWorkId}
