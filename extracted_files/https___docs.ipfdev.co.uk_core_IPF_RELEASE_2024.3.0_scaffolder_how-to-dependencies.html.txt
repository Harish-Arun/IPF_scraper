How do you use your own parent dependency?
Projects created by this scaffolder will use the IPF Bill Of Materials (BOM) as a parent, if you wish to use a custom
parent POM, then make the following changes after project creation to ensure that the correct ipf dependencies are included:
<dependencyManagement>
     <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.iconsolutions.ipf</groupId>
            <artifactId>ipf-release-bom</artifactId>
            <version>__IPF_VERSION__</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
